        <h2>What We Learned Starting an Intensive Design Class</h2>

        <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This is a post from Marco Suarez explaining what we&rsquo;ve learned on the journey of starting an intensive design school.</em></p>

<p>There is a gap that is widening between the education students are receiving and the skills companies require. The most obvious disconnect is in software and technology. Universities fail to keep up and the proponents of an informal, self-taught education use that deficiency as their banner. But technology and software are platforms and tools. And just because you know how to use a tool doesn’t make you a craftsman. The more serious gap is in a person’s ability to think. Mobile touch platforms have radically changed the way we use technology, so much so that it has caused broad societal shift. The potential of this shift is fueling investors to pour insane amounts of money into people and ideas that take advantage of it. There is a need for designers who can think critically and creatively to solve real problems by utilizing these new platforms and tools.</p>

        <div class="entry-content"><p><em>From our Product Design instructor, <a href="http://twitter.com/marcosuarez">Marco</a>:</em></p>

<p>Education is a hot topic. Does the value of a diploma out weight the ever-rising cost of tuition? I think the answer is overwhelmingly yes for some careers. But not all. In the world of design, what you’ve done carries more weight than where you went to school. That has been a known truth for quite some years. But with the advent of smart phones and tablets, the demand for qualified digital product designers has seen an unprecedented uptick. So how are designers learning these lucrative skills?</p>

<p>Universities excel at offering strong foundations of design theory, peer collaboration, and a period of focus and dedication, but at a mortgage level price tag.The problem is not only the cost; universities struggle to keep up with how quickly the design industry evolves. Never before has design been so tightly melded with technology. Terms like user experience, mobile design and interface design are becoming commonplace on design job boards but largely absent in curriculums.</p>

<p>Online learning has been evolving over the last few years to supplement, if not replace a formal education. These programs have growth rates that would make any CEO green with envy. Their model is a nominal monthly fee in exchange for video tutorials and projects that educate the viewer on cutting edge trends in website and app development. But where these programs excel at teaching the latest software and technology, they lack in one-on-one guidance, emphasis on design theory, and in-person collaboration with other students.</p>

<p>So are these the only options? Is there not something that fits in the gap between these avenues of education? We think so. And that’s what we&rsquo;re building at The Iron Yard. This year we started an <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/education/academy">Academy</a>, offering affordable, accessible three-month-intensive classes in Greenville, SC. We just started a front-end engineering class and we’re gearing up to start a <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/education/academy/product-design">digital product design class this May</a>.</p>

<p>Our digital product design course will teach students the process of design thinking, how to develop ideas based on data and observation, create and test prototypes, build brands, design interfaces for web and mobile, and teach them cutting-edge technology and software.</p>

<p>They’ll have one-on-one guidance from a seasoned professional designer, work collaboratively and individually, and tackle live projects that benefit real people.They’ll have exposure to startups in our accelerator program and opportunities to meet and learn from some of the best and brightest designers in the industry. (Course mentors include Matthew Smith, Aaron Walter, and Josh Brewer.)</p>

<p>We will provide housing just down the road from our facility in downtown Greenville and a bike for transportation. All day-to-day necessities are in walking distance. We’ll also provide a brand new Apple laptop and access to Adobe’s Creative Cloud during the course &ndash; that way our students can focus all their attention on the course and projects.</p>

<p>Our mission is not to replace a formal education nor the need for online learning, but fill a gap that our shifting industry has created, train people for great jobs, and build meaningful projects in the process.</p>
