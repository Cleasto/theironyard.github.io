          </p>
        
        <div class="entry-content"><p>The Startup Life™ is thickly shrouded with threats of difficulty. First you&rsquo;re required to have an astoundingly novel idea that promises to capture a gigantic industry or market. (Or at least be able to convince people of those things.) Next, you need a killer team, preferably one with a brilliant engineer co-founder who&rsquo;s willing to give up a six-figure income to work tirelessly on your product.</p>

<p>Later you discover that the importance of the idea pales in comparison to execution: if you can&rsquo;t ship, you&rsquo;re dead in the water. Courting VCs and negotiating term sheets, if you&rsquo;re one of the lucky few to beat that many levels and face the boss, is a black art in and of itself, and one wrong step can flush everything you&rsquo;ve worked for down the drain. Work/life balance as most know isn&rsquo;t even part of the equation for many entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>After running an accelerator program for 7 months, though, I&rsquo;ve learned that one of the most trying hurdles is the minefield of different &lsquo;advice&rsquo; startups get along the way.</p>

<p>Early stage companies &ndash; especially those in mentorship-driven programs &ndash; face an inordinate flood of conflicting opinions on every aspect of their company. From inconsequential design details to overall strategy, teams can receive unending praise and completely deflating interrogation in the same day. Both types of feedback come from successful people who&rsquo;s resumés command a level of respect.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t have strong conviction about your product and company, incongruous advice can toss you like a row boat in a hurricane. If you question your your compass enough times, it can be hard to remember why you started the journey in the first place.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that stubbornness has killed many companies, but requiring clear and convincing evidence to change has made some of the most successful businesses in the world just that.</p>

<p>There is no lack of smart people, good ideas, and money to put behind them. My bet will be on teams with real conviction.</p>

        <h2>What We Learned Starting an Intensive Design Class</h2>
        
          <p class="meta">
            








  


<time datetime="2013-05-04T09:41:58-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 4<span>th</span>, 2013</time>
            
          </p>
        
        <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This is a post from Marco Suarez explaining what we&rsquo;ve learned on the journey of starting an intensive design school.</em></p>

<p>There is a gap that is widening between the education students are receiving and the skills companies require. The most obvious disconnect is in software and technology. Universities fail to keep up and the proponents of an informal, self-taught education use that deficiency as their banner. But technology and software are platforms and tools. And just because you know how to use a tool doesn’t make you a craftsman. The more serious gap is in a person’s ability to think. Mobile touch platforms have radically changed the way we use technology, so much so that it has caused broad societal shift. The potential of this shift is fueling investors to pour insane amounts of money into people and ideas that take advantage of it. There is a need for designers who can think critically and creatively to solve real problems by utilizing these new platforms and tools.</p>

<p>And this is where The Iron Yard comes into the story. The Iron Yard is a company in the southeast that has set up residence at the gates of new tech ideation. And we saw an opportunity. We know software and technology really well and we know companies that are hiring. So we started an <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/education/academy/front-end-engineering">intensive front end engineering program</a> this year that is doing great. So great that we decided to spin up a <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/education/academy/product-design">design program</a> that focuses on digital product design. We’d teach the process of design thinking through building real applications for real people. We’d assess problems and build prototypes, brands, and interfaces for web and mobile. Sounded like a home run. So we thought.</p>

<p>The vast differences between teaching code and design &ndash; and recruiting students for each discipline &ndash; taught us a lot about the state of education. Teaching code is similar to teaching math—either you know it or you don’t. Design is different. It’s subjective. It assembles culture, metaphors, art, and taste with problems, challenges, and data. So you could say it is similar to teaching English. A lot of people think they’re good enough at English that they don’t need to further their learning of the language.</p>

<p>Another observation is the people in our front end engineering program didn’t have any previous experience with code, and they didn’t need to. After a month of class, they were as proficient as me and I’ve been doing this stuff for a decade. Kudos to their teacher, Mason Stewart. But our design program wasn’t a foundational design course. It was a higher learning program that would add another tool to their design toolbox. This changed our target market drastically. In the pool of designers, we were targeting those who wanted to shift out of designing consumables (websites, advertising, and marketing) to designing software for startups. So our task was to get our program in front of those people.</p>

<p>We tried some PR, social media, and whatever else but to no avail. And then we remembered <a href="http://blog.theironyard.com/2013/04/the-gap-or-why-we-started-a-design-course/">the gap</a>. Universities do a good job giving students a solid design foundation. They give students four years to get it wrong, experiment, and expand their minds. This was a foundation we could build on. So we scheduled some meetings with local universities and found an overwhelmingly positive response to what we were offering. Universities recognize where they’re falling short and supplementing their program with ours seemed like a match made in heaven. So we narrowed our focus to students. This is where it got interesting.</p>

<p>I assumed that this technologically saturated generation would be so starved for digital literacy that our program would be cool water to their lips. But I could not have been more wrong. These students all owned iPhones, Androids, and tablets and computers of all kinds. They’re all active users on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and all sorts of apps but none of them had ever thought they could work for one of these companies. When I mentioned that we would be learning to write some code, I completely lost them. At that point our class was not only foreign, it was intimidating. And who is going to sign away three months of their lives and a bunch of money to be intimidated and frustrated and then be placed in an ever more intimidating and frustrating job?</p>

<p>Two weeks away from the inaugural launch of our class, we had two signups. We approached students just weeks away from graduation about pretty much changing the trajectory of their career. Not such a good idea. In order to create action you have to first reveal the need for action. And we were asking these students to act before they fully realized the need. We were a little overzealous. But we believe the greatest need for our program is in bridging the gap between universities and companies.And now that we know our target market, we can form a plan that entices students early on, accommodates their schedules and budgets, and place them in jobs where they can fully utilize their minds and their knowledge of software and technology.</p>

<p>We’re working out ideas like one day classes on Saturdays, classes that fit into a normal semester, and the summer long intensive program with a guaranteed job placement. Whatever the end product looks like, the need is growing, and The Iron Yard is passionate about training the next generation of great designers.</p>

        <h2>Kate McCarthy: Five Things I Learned at LessConf</h2>
        
          <p class="meta">
            








  


<time datetime="2013-04-15T15:00:06-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 15<span>th</span>, 2013</time>
            
          </p>
        
        <div class="entry-content"><p>This weekend I had the opportunity to attend LessConf. As a new comer to the tech/startup world and a first timer at what has to be (for lack of a better term) <em>the __coolest conference in the history</em>, I wanted to share a few take aways. Here are the top five things I learned at LessConf.</p>

<p><strong>1)   It’s better to be awesome than perfect.</strong> Hosts <a href="mailto:https://twitter.com/allanbranch">Allan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/stevenbristol">Steve</a> and their international clan of programming weirdo cool kids really drove this home for me.  Steve’s response to weak wifi in the old movie theater where the first batch of talks went down: “I don’t care.  You shouldn’t be on the internet anyway.” These guys really embody the ethos of striving for awesomeness rather than perfection.</p>

<p><strong>2)   E-mail attachments might be your golden ticket.  </strong>Just ask <a href="https://twitter.com/Ryohara">Ryan O’Hara</a> from <a href="http://dyn.com/">Dyn</a> who gave some sage advice on how to craft cold e-mails. EX: after a potential client he reached out to didn’t respond, he followed up with an email + photo attachment of him lying prostrate and depressed on the floor. Rule of thumb, even if you don’t get their business, make them fall in love with you.****</p>

<p><strong>3)   Baby kangaroos are my kryptonite. </strong>At the opening dinner we were introduced to magical wildlife including a baby alligator and this absurdly adorable baby kangaroo. Just look at him!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.theironyard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Untitled.png"><img src="http://blog.theironyard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Untitled.png" alt="Untitled" /></a></p>

<p><strong>4)   Ask and ye shall receive.</strong> The basics were well covered: from bug spray to sun screen (thanks <a href="https://www.engineyard.com">Engine Yard</a>) there wasn&rsquo;t much wanting. The above and beyond came from conversations with the world class humans. Ex: Over breakfast, I lamented the difficulty we non-technical people have communicating desired website changes to our fabulous techie friends. Dun dah dah dun! Enter<a href="https://twitter.com/jayroh"> Joel Oliveira</a> from ThoughtBot who blew my mind with a demo of <a href="http://evernote.com/skitch/">Skitch</a>. THANK YOU.****</p>

<p><strong>5)   Kill features that don&rsquo;t increase revenue.</strong> On day two of talks, we took to the ocean for more pearls of wisdom. <a href="https://twitter.com/Shpigford">Josh Pigford</a> of <a href="https://www.popsurvey.com">Pop Survey</a> explained the urge to constantly ship new features, you know, a more is more philosophy. Instead, he encouraged the audience to kill any feature that doesn’t increase your revenue. Revenue neutral? Adios. I’d say this goes for life too. Often we add activities, classes, cleanses, and other “features” to our lives better. My challenge? Kill the features that don’t improve your bottom line of awesome.****</p>

<p><strong>And just because I can, I’m going to add a sixth and final learning.</strong> Probably the biggest one of all. The tech/startup world is full of compassionate, alarmingly intelligent, bizarre, supportive, non-judgmental, goal oriented world class humans. I can’t imagine a better group to call my tribe.</p>

<p>Also, you&rsquo;ve probably noticed the lack of obese animal picture in the post. Sorry about that, but I couldn&rsquo;t bear scrolling through our blog because I realized it was one big stream of fat creature photos, so I took a week off.</p>

<p><strong>1) Along with launching a code school, we announced a product design class taught by Marco Suarez. </strong> <a href="https://medium.com/tech-talk/fce9d38d2290">He wrote an amazing post called &ldquo;The Gap&rdquo; about why we started a design school</a>. Here&rsquo;s a taste:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our mission is not to replace a formal education nor the need for online learning, but fill a gap that our shifting industry has created, train people for great jobs, and build meaningful projects in the process.</p></blockquote>

        <div class="entry-content"><p><em>From our Product Design instructor, <a href="http://twitter.com/marcosuarez">Marco</a>:</em></p>

<p>Education is a hot topic. Does the value of a diploma out weight the ever-rising cost of tuition? I think the answer is overwhelmingly yes for some careers. But not all. In the world of design, what you’ve done carries more weight than where you went to school. That has been a known truth for quite some years. But with the advent of smart phones and tablets, the demand for qualified digital product designers has seen an unprecedented uptick. So how are designers learning these lucrative skills?</p>

<p>Universities excel at offering strong foundations of design theory, peer collaboration, and a period of focus and dedication, but at a mortgage level price tag.The problem is not only the cost; universities struggle to keep up with how quickly the design industry evolves. Never before has design been so tightly melded with technology. Terms like user experience, mobile design and interface design are becoming commonplace on design job boards but largely absent in curriculums.</p>

<p>Online learning has been evolving over the last few years to supplement, if not replace a formal education. These programs have growth rates that would make any CEO green with envy. Their model is a nominal monthly fee in exchange for video tutorials and projects that educate the viewer on cutting edge trends in website and app development. But where these programs excel at teaching the latest software and technology, they lack in one-on-one guidance, emphasis on design theory, and in-person collaboration with other students.</p>

<p>So are these the only options? Is there not something that fits in the gap between these avenues of education? We think so. And that’s what we&rsquo;re building at The Iron Yard. This year we started an <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/education/academy">Academy</a>, offering affordable, accessible three-month-intensive classes in Greenville, SC. We just started a front-end engineering class and we’re gearing up to start a <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/education/academy/product-design">digital product design class this May</a>.</p>

<p>Our digital product design course will teach students the process of design thinking, how to develop ideas based on data and observation, create and test prototypes, build brands, design interfaces for web and mobile, and teach them cutting-edge technology and software.</p>

<p>They’ll have one-on-one guidance from a seasoned professional designer, work collaboratively and individually, and tackle live projects that benefit real people.They’ll have exposure to startups in our accelerator program and opportunities to meet and learn from some of the best and brightest designers in the industry. (Course mentors include Matthew Smith, Aaron Walter, and Josh Brewer.)</p>

<p>We will provide housing just down the road from our facility in downtown Greenville and a bike for transportation. All day-to-day necessities are in walking distance. We’ll also provide a brand new Apple laptop and access to Adobe’s Creative Cloud during the course &ndash; that way our students can focus all their attention on the course and projects.</p>

<p>Our mission is not to replace a formal education nor the need for online learning, but fill a gap that our shifting industry has created, train people for great jobs, and build meaningful projects in the process.</p>
