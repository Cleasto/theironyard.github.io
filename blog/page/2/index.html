<p>The author analyzes the good and bad of the <em>&ldquo;Billions of the EU dollars that pour into Poland each year&hellip;intended to promote entrepreneurship and innovation. As Warsaw rushes to dole out the cash, a startup boom has been born–but can state subsidies really act as seed capital, and what will happen when the EU turns off the spigots?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re adding two new locations this spring. In a few weeks we&rsquo;ll launch a space on Main Street in Downtown Greenville called &ldquo;The Forge,&rdquo; and by summer we&rsquo;ll be up and running in Spartanburg at &ldquo;The Mill.&rdquo; Both locations will house accelerator classes as well as CoWorking space. Our original location, known simply as CoWork, is now called &ldquo;Railside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In celebration, we wanted to invite you on a walk through the space that started it all, CoWork at Railside.</p>

        <h2>The Iron Yard Academy: Front End Engineering Class Applications are OPEN</h2>
        
          <p class="meta">
            








  


<time datetime="2013-02-22T13:56:06-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 22<span>nd</span>, 2013</time>
            
          </p>
        
        <div class="entry-content"><p>For the last month we&rsquo;ve been working on a project called The Iron Yard Academy, and we&rsquo;re excited to announce that <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/academy/apply">applications are open</a> for our <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/academy/the-iron-yard-academy">Front End Engineering</a> class.</p>

<p><strong>What is this Iron Yard Academy, you ask?</strong></p>

<p>The Academy is a collection of intensive, in-person programming and design courses, built to take students from zero to hero in a short amount of time. When they complete the program, we&rsquo;ll help place them in a job. Other schools like this exist, but not in the Southeast.</p>

<p><strong>What subjects will you teach?</strong></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve opened applications for our three-month Front End Engineering class, and will launch a UX/UI course later this spring. We hope to add iOS and Rails courses later in the year.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of instructors are teaching these classes?</strong></p>

<p>Our Front End instructor (and the head of our Academy program) is <a href="http://twitter.com/masondesu">Mason Stewart</a>. He&rsquo;s a seasoned engineer, and he&rsquo;s worked for small, Southern boutique web shops, startups from San Francisco to Greenville, and everywhere in between. He also heads up <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/academy/kids">CoderDojo Greenville</a>, teaching over 40 kids per week how to program in Scratch and JavaScript. (Check out a <a href="http://vimeo.com/58981618#at=0">video from the class</a>.)</p>

<p>Also, we can&rsquo;t say who just quite yet, but we recently hired a genius-level instructor for our upcoming UX/UI class. More news on that soon.</p>

<p><strong>What will students be ready for after taking the courses?</strong></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll prepare students for in the Front End class:</p>

<p>You will be qualified as a professional, junior-level JavaScript and front-end engineer.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Join a startup and get a solid prototype off the ground quickly and efficiently</p></li>
<li><p>Build digital products for web development shop, agency, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Build non-trivial, fast, efficient, production-quality apps</p></li>
<li><p>Build gorgeous websites</p></li>
<li><p>Most importantly, learn how to learn</p></li>
</ul>


<p>You won&rsquo;t know absolutely everything there is to know, but we will ensure that you <em>know how to learn it</em> if you need to.</p>

<p><strong>Ok, fancy pants, how much will this cost?</strong></p>

<p>$9,750, including housing and a MacBook air that you get to keep. For real.</p>

<p><strong>CAN I APPLY RIGHT NOW??</strong></p>

<p>Absolutely. <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/academy/the-iron-yard-academy">Head over to our website</a>, read about the course, and <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/academy/apply">sign on up</a>. We&rsquo;ve had lots of strong applicants already, so get it while it&rsquo;s hot.</p>

We agree! That&rsquo;s what CoderDojo is for. Here&rsquo;s a snippet:</p>

<blockquote><p>The president went on to reference a dinner with Mark Zuckerberg, during which the Facebook founder said he taught himself programming primarily because he was interested in games. Giving high school students the opportunity to delve into such interests, President Obama said, but showing that it requires a knowledge of math and science, and making that training available in high school, “not only prepares young people who may choose not to go to a four-year college to be job-ready, but it also engages kids.</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, those good feelings won&rsquo;t last in every case. We&rsquo;re not trying to rain on anyone&rsquo;s lovey-dovey parade here, we&rsquo;re just facing the facts, and we have some good <a href="news:">news:</a></p>

        <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s no secret that consumer demand for personalized products and experiences is increasing at incredible speed, and that demand is creating new standards.</p>

<blockquote><p>Nobody gets this perfect, because humans don’t make sense. Our tastes are not neatly defined. I legitimately enjoy listening to D’Angelo, Nickelback and Huey Lewis so… good luck with music suggestions for me, Rdio. Lo, I Am Become Enigma, Destroyer of Algorithms. Netflix or Amazon regularly suggest the most ridiculous things to me. But they’re trying. Tweaking. Spending millions of man hours and dollars to improve those algorithms by 1%, because 1% more relevant is a massive improvement. —<a href="http://joshuablankenship.com/blog/2012/08/14/how-tripit-and-zynga-are-blowing-it-with-my-data/">Joshua Blankenship</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Spent, one of our alumni, is excited about this trend, and they&rsquo;re building products that will help all types of companies provide relevance to their users.</p>

<p>Their team set out to build a recommendation engine for the grocery industry, allowing stores to offer personalized offers based on customer purchase behavior. As they dug into the world of relevance, though they realized how powerful the technology could be for just about any industry.</p>

<p>They took a few steps back, built their product as an API anyone can use, and <a href="https://www.relify.com/index">Relify</a> was born as their first product.</p>

<p>Relify provides recommendations as a service and is geared towards developers, offering quick and easy integration with their apps:</p>

<p>_&ldquo;Relify eliminates the complexity of building a recommendation engine from scratch, and makes it simple for companies to use the data they already have to reduce the paradox of choice. The solution fits companies that track data about their customers but don’t understand how to use it, or don’t have the resources to tackle building their own recommendation engine.</p>

<p>Relify’s technology uses existing recommendation algorithms, combined with proprietary methods, to quickly analyze data and serve recommendations. Using data generated from everyday activities like buying groceries or browsing the Internet, recommendations are personalized for each user. Developers import their data, create data sets and use recommenders to customize the types of recommendations they use in their applications.&ldquo;_</p>

<p><strong>1) With the internet being so young, it&rsquo;s funny to think about reminiscing about &ldquo;the way it used to be&rdquo; on the web.</strong> Still, Anil Dash&rsquo;s article called <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html">The Web We Lost</a> is an interesting look at what&rsquo;s changed, and what social networks have had to do with it. Here&rsquo;s a teaser:</p>

<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ll fix these things; I don&rsquo;t worry about that. The technology industry, like all industries, follows cycles, and the pendulum is swinging back to the broad, empowering philosophies that underpinned the early social web. But we&rsquo;re going to face a big challenge with re-educating a billion people about what the web means, akin to the years we spent as everyone moved off of AOL a decade ago, teaching them that there was so much more to the experience of the Internet than what they know.</p></blockquote>

        <div class="entry-content"><p>Ask any small business and they&rsquo;ll tell you that accepting recurring payments is either a huge hassle, overly expensive, or probably both. Sure, there are awesome point of sale tools for almost any type of vendor (Square, etc.), but if your business runs any type of subscription based product or service, you&rsquo;re probably in for a headache.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.moonclerk.com/">MoonClerk</a>, Iron Yard 2012 alumni.</p>

<p>Dodd Caldwell, the founder, was really fed up with having to either develop fully custom payment solutions for each new project, or use  existing providers that were painful to work with (ahem, PayPal, ahem). So he decided to solve the problem from the ground up.</p>

<p>In a sentence, here&rsquo;s what it does:</p>

<blockquote><p>MoonClerk is a web-based service designed to help small businesses easily accept recurring and one-time online payments.</p></blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;But they can already do that!&rdquo; you say. True, but not without a lot of difficulty or a lot of money. In fact, you don&rsquo;t have to have any technical capability to use MoonClerk. It differentiates itself from e-commerce solutions and point-of-sale systems such as Square by allowing businesses to gather credit card information from their customer or donors and then charging that credit card on a recurring or subscription basis.</p>

<p>And, it&rsquo;s amazingly easy to set up and use:</p>

<blockquote><p>Businesses can set up MoonClerk without any technical or programming skills. The entire setup process generally takes around 5 minutes to begin accepting payments because there are no merchant accounts, payment gateways, or other systems to apply for and implement. MoonClerk provides bank-level security so businesses don&rsquo;t need to deal with SSL certificates or PCI compliance. Checkout works on all devices &ndash; desktop and mobile.</p></blockquote>

<p>Not only that, but it automates some of the annoying administrative tasks associtated with running a small business:</p>

<blockquote><p>So, for instance, a lawn care service can set a customer up on-site with a subscription payment and then forget about having to send and collect on invoices. We also help them with some of the back-office issues, like sending out automatic receipts.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what Dodd had to say about building the product:</p>

<blockquote><p>When my co-founder, Ryan Wood, and I decided to build MoonClerk, we really wanted to help businesses convert customers. When someone decides to pay you or donate to you, you want them to complete the process. By giving our customers control of the design of the checkout experience and other great tools, we&rsquo;re able to help them accomplish that goal. PayPal was one of the only recurring systems out there for small businesses and it didn&rsquo;t really allow non-technical users to do that.</p></blockquote>

<p>How much does it cost? MoonClerk piggybacks on payment processor Stripe. Businesses can set up a Stripe account while activating their MoonClerk accounts. Funds are automatically transferred into the business&rsquo;s bank account, and pricing starts at $9/month. Stripe charges 2.9% + $.30 per successful transaction.</p>

<p>Three cheers for an amazing product, Dodd and Ryan.</p>
