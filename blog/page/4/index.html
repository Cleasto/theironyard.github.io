<time datetime="2013-01-10T10:08:27-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 10<span>th</span>, 2013</time>

        <div class="entry-content"><p>I had the privilege of being asked by GAN to write a series of posts on their blog. Here&rsquo;s the story and the first article:</p>

<p><em>Meet Eric Dodds, first year Program Manager at South Carolina based accelerator The Iron Yard. As The Iron Yard gears up for their second program, we thought it would be interesting to ask Eric to share the insiders perspective as he cuts his teeth. Good news for us, he agreed to tell all… and it turns out he’s pretty funny too. He’ll be updating us about once a month, so be sure to keep coming back to hear his new adventures. Take it away Eric…</em></p>

<p>If you had said the words ‘Seed Round’ to me two years ago, I would have assumed you worked in landscaping. But change can do a lot with two years, and as I write this I’m surrounded by entrepreneurs at an accelerator. And none of them work in landscaping. But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p>

<p>My name is Eric Dodds, and I’m the Program Manager for The Iron Yard.</p>

<p>I ended up here after a winding road of education, marketing, attempts to escape to the Rocky Mountains, and craft beer. Here’s the short version: I had a job doing project management and strategy for a marketing firm, working shoulder to shoulder work with top-notch companies like Best Buy (in the good days), Double Day Publishing, and Anytime Fitness. I loved my job, but constantly found myself procrastinating by reading about technology, entrepreneurship, and even trying to start a few companies. About that same time, my path crossed Peter Barth’s, who happened to be the Managing Director at an accelerator, and who also happened to need an extra pair of hands. I decided to follow my procrastination, quit my job, and dive head-first into startup land. (You can read the whole saga <a href="http://ericdodds.com/follow-your-procrastination/">here</a>.)</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.theironyard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/23_large.jpeg"><img src="http://blog.theironyard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/23_large-e1357239755355.jpeg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Which is where you come in. Well, kind of. It’s where Sarah Jane and Patrick (here at GAN) come in. I had the pleasure of meeting both at the recent <a href="http://blog.theironyard.com/2012/11/what-the-iron-yard-learned-at-the-gan-founders-conference/">GAN Founders Conference</a> in Boston. We all became friends, and I happened to mention to Sarah Jane that I had no idea what I was doing in my new job. Before the words finished leaving my mouth, we both realized it might be fun, maybe even helpful, for people to follow along as I learn the ropes.</p>

<p>So, starting in January, I’ll be writing a regular feature about what the life of a Program Manager looks like.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the things we’ll talk about:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>‘Operations,’ or how the heck you keep all your plates spinning</p></li>
<li><p>Starting an accelerator in a smaller, traditionally non-tech savvy area (in our case, the Southeast)</p></li>
<li><p>Promoting the program</p></li>
<li><p>Attracting good teams</p></li>
<li><p>Mentors</p></li>
<li><p>And more</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I think it will be a fun ride, and we’d love it if you joined. I love meeting new people, so feel free to shoot me an email at eric [at] theironyard [dot] com.</p>

        <h2>CoderDojo: building arduino video game controllers for Scratch, from scratch</h2>

<time datetime="2013-01-08T10:19:09-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 8<span>th</span>, 2013</time>
            
          </p>
        
        <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s happening!!!</p>

<p>This Thursday will be the first session of our brand-spanking new Arduino <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/academy/kids">CoderDojo</a> class, and I couldn’t be more excited! And, something tells me I’m not the only one in the class who’s going to have a blast.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.theironyard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/esplora-happy.jpg"><img src="http://blog.theironyard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/esplora-happy.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>In December (when I was first trying to figure out what I was going to do with 15 kids and 15 Arduinos) I came to Mason’s CoderDojo Scratch class, with a few “toys” in hand, and chatted with the kids about what they might like to make out of electronics. The first question that came from most of them was “Well, what can you make?” So I started rattling off ideas in (typical Anne-style) rapid fire:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A ball that sings when you throw it?</p></li>
<li><p>A circuit that tells you the temperature by the color of it’s light?</p></li>
<li><p>A “Shh” meter, that tells everyone to be quieter when they get too loud?</p></li>
<li><p>A “Coffee-Thief Zapper” that shocks the lazy guy in your office who keeps taking the last cup of coffee without making a new pot?  (Ok, maybe not a good suggestion for kids, but it’s at the top of my to-do list.)</p></li>
<li><p>A game controller that you could make from scratch, to control your made-from-scratch Scratch game?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>And the choir sang “Gaaaame Controllllller!” in perfect harmony. Ok, that was easy.</p>

<p>So, I spent the next few days trying to figure out what I was going to need to help 15 kids make game controllers. I had a few ideas, all of which required an <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardLeonardo">Arduino Leonardo</a> (with easy, built-in Keyboard/Mouse library functions). With that in mind, I dropped my Arduino friends a note, asking if the relatively new Leonardo was ready for the gauntlet a 10 year old user would run it through. “Sure,” they said, “But, you might want to look at the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardEsplora">Esplora</a>. We think it would be a perfect fit for your class.”</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.theironyard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/arduino-esplora-kit.jpg"><img src="http://blog.theironyard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/arduino-esplora-kit.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I won’t lie. The Esplora was not at all what I had in mind&hellip; what about the breadboard? The wires?  The hookup diagrams?  Isn’t that the <a href="http://learn.adafruit.com/assets/2442">fun part</a>? Is it <del>possible</del> <del>likely</del> certain that my perceptions/opinions are being colored by my extremely specialized professional experience as an Analog/RF-centric Electrical Engineer?</p>

<p>It turns out, everyone who I show the Esplora to thinks it is AWESOME! And, for sure, it is awesome&hellip; I’m not sure I’ve ever seen so many sensors (and an Arduino) on one board before. OK, OK, not only am I now convinced, I am also super excited. Excited that we can hit the ground running on Day 1, make cool sensor circuits, interact with our environment, and control whatever PC program we want. (And, when we’re ready, we’ll pull out the breadboards and dig into how some of these sensors actually work. :) )</p>

<p>So let me wrap this up with a few thank you&rsquo;s. Thank you so much to my new Iron Yard/CoWork friends who have helped get this class off the ground &ndash; I can’t wait to see where this goes! And, a big, big hug to my friends at Arduino, who have offered guidance and sponsorship, and who worked hard to ensure we’d have the hardware we needed in time for our first class &ndash; many thanks!</p>

<p>-Anne</p>

<p><em>Anne Mahaffey is a super-friend of The Iron Yard, is passionate about electronics hardware, and can&rsquo;t wait to share that passion with the kids at CoderDojo. Anne, we&rsquo;re incredibly grateful for everything you do.</em></p>

<p><strong>1) Today&rsquo;s noodle-worker comes from a blog called &ldquo;Mr. Money Mustache,&rdquo; so you know it&rsquo;s going to be awesome.</strong>.
An article called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/12/26/cure-yourself-of-tiny-details-exaggeration-syndrome/">Cure Yourself of Tiny Details Exaggeration Syndrome</a>&rdquo; was floated around the net a bit, and we thought it was self-reflective, kind of new years resolution-y, and all that other stuff that makes you feel optimistic about the future. Here&rsquo;s a quote to whet the palette:</p>

<blockquote><p>Despite their advantaged position, people seem to become unaware of the wide variety of conditions in the world and their own ability as a human to deal with them. The results are both tragic and amusing.</p></blockquote>

<p>3) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWCBk9Vl-rc">Someone flying off of a playground carousel powered by a motorcycle. </a>.</p>

<p>4) The Iron Yard launched a <a href="http://theironyard.com">snazzy new website</a>. <em>(See what we did there?)</em></p>

        <div class="entry-content"><p>We have some great New Year&rsquo;s surprises for you.</p>

<h4>1) We re-branded.</h4>

<p>Over the past few months we&rsquo;ve worked with the uber-talented <a href="http://www.justinhalldesign.com/">Justin Hall</a> to refine the look and feel of our brand. We&rsquo;re really excited about our new outfit, and we&rsquo;ll write in more detail about the process in the coming weeks.</p>

<h4>2) We launched a new website.</h4>

<p>Along with the brand, we&rsquo;ve just pushed a shiny <a href="http://theironyard.com">new site</a> live. It&rsquo;s hot off the Rails, so let us know if you find any quirks.</p>

<h4>3) We have some new faces in the office.</h4>

<p>I realized that we forgot to officially announce my arrival on the blog, so we&rsquo;ll say this counts.</p>

<p>More importantly, though, we&rsquo;ve brought on Kate McCarthy as our Spartanburg program manager. She&rsquo;s awesome.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;WAIT, Spartanburg??&rdquo;</em> you say? Yes, Spartanburg. We&rsquo;re excited to announce that we&rsquo;ll run a second accelerator classes this year focused on healthcare IT.</p>

<h4>Happy New Year from The Iron Yard!</h4>

<p><strong>1) In the spirit of both post-holiday shopping as well as dealings with VCs and Angels, today&rsquo;s Think Link is about negotiation.</strong>.
Quartz ran a <a href="http://qz.com/39074/how-to-negotiate-for-anything/">great piece</a> called &ldquo;How to negotiate for anything&rdquo; that includes an awesome story about a former FBI negotiator purchasing a car.</p>

<p><strong>1) Our Link That Actually Makes You Think™ is about how phones are getting, well, really really smart</strong>.
Pando Daily ran a piece about &lsquo;app overload&rsquo; that discussed machine learning and how &ldquo;your smartphone already knows you better than your mom does.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re really intrigued by recent talk on services like <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/now/">Google Now</a> and <a href="http://www.grokrlabs.com/product">Grokr</a>, and yes, artificial intelligence.

<p>In response we discussed our findings with event planners, business owners and other vendors to gauge interest in using our software. The response was favorable! With this in mind we wanted to create a brand that was open to many local establishments, thus Locally was formed.

So, we proudly present Lazy Friday Links, Vol. 2.</p>

<p>Click well, my friends.</p>

<p><strong>1) We generally start with something that actually requires thought, then quickly degenerate from there</strong>.
We ran across <a href="http://www.elezea.com/2012/12/maybe-it-doesnt-suck/">a post from Rian van der Merwe</a> that challenged people to stop saying everything sucks. Critique flows abundantly in accelerators, where ideas are vetted, re-vetted, and vetted again. It&rsquo;s Lazy Friday, so here&rsquo;s our favorite quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s easy to write a few paragraphs about how much something sucks. You know what’s difficult? Recognizing and respecting complexity. Giving people the benefit of the doubt and trying to understand why they made the decisions they made&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>2) Oh my <a href="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/infocus/ngpc112812/s_n39_thegreat.jpg">shark eating seal</a>.</p>

        <div class="entry-content"><p>Who writes anything that requires critical thinking on Friday? You? Well hats off, good sir. I feel like I wrote a small novel this week, so I&rsquo;m introducing a dazzling new feature called Lazy Friday Links.</p>

<p>Click well, my friends.</p>

<p><strong>1) Let&rsquo;s start with something serious and go downhill from there</strong>.
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">This Paul Graham post</a> about startup ideas wrought some interesting conversation among a few of our teams. Marty from RidePost sent us <a href="http://mattmaroon.com/2012/11/21/startup-ideas/">a great article</a> that questioned the Graham post, and Earl from Tribr sent us an awesome reminder called &ldquo;<a href="http://viniciusvacanti.com/2012/11/19/the-depressing-day-after-you-get-techcrunched/">The Depressing Day After You Get TechCrunched.</a>&rdquo;</p>

<p>2) Awesome GIF Time, <a href="http://i46.tinypic.com/zt7vpj.gif">avoiding work edition</a>.</p>

<p>3) All of the airplane landings at Sandiego International Airport on Nov. 23rd, <a href="http://vimeo.com/54658957">back-to-back-to-back.</a></p>

<p>4) <a href="http://blog.theironyard.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/urn-your-biz.jpg">Awesomely bad advertising</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, we almost forgot an <a href="http://kittencube.com/">obligatory cat-related-something</a>. (Hand crafted by our very own <a href="https://twitter.com/skinnysc">David Haskins</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/cowork">CoWork</a>.)</p>

<p>Happy Friday.</p>

        <div class="entry-content"><p>Under30CEO recently published a few smart articles from Marty Bauer of RidePost. Here&rsquo;s a preview of his wise words for startups:</p>

<h6><a href="http://under30ceo.com/top-5-apps-for-your-startup/">Top 5 Apps For Your Startup</a></h6>

<p>With countless apps available and dozens that I’ve downloaded personally, there are actually only a few that truly help your business everyday. As a lean startup, I quickly learned the importance of great and free apps. Below is my list of top apps for your startup and mine. <a href="http://under30ceo.com/top-5-apps-for-your-startup/"><em>Read the full article.</em></a></p>

<h6><a href="http://under30ceo.com/when-is-the-best-time-to-start-a-startup/">When Is The Best Time To Start A Startup?</a></h6>

<p>“But now is not the best time” – Everyone else</p>

<p>Accept a dream job, graduate, leave that dream job, convince three other people to do the same, launch a startup, land seed funding, marry the girl of your dreams, move to a new city, leave the country for three weeks.</p>

<p>Logic says not to do more than two of these in a year. I did all of them in less than a month. If I can do all of that within a month – and survive – then you can do it too.</p>
