<time datetime="2012-11-27T11:08:59-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 27<span>th</span>, 2012</time>
            
          </p>
        
        <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago we packed up our accelerator and headed north for the <a href="http://gan.co/blog/events/ganfounder-2012-in-review">GAN Founders Conference</a> in Boston.</p>

<p>Along with some bangin&#8217; vietnamese food, local beer, and watching <a href="https://twitter.com/Rich_Winley">Rich Winley</a> freeze, we met amazing entrepreneurs and learned from really smart people.</p>

<p>Here are a few takeaways from our teams:</p>

<h6>Steve Palmer from <em><a href="https://www.truckylove.com/">Trucky Love</a></em></h6>

<p>For the TruckyLove team, we enjoyed being in a room full of startup founders who all have experienced or are experiencing many of the same challenges. It was great to have access to so many people, from founders to investors, and learn from the great speakers.</p>

<h6>Mark Liu from <em><a href="https://www.leaguevine.com/">Leaguevine</a></em></h6>

<p>The GAN Conference was a great way to meet amazing CEOs from other parts of the world. There was a ton of time for socializing at bars and I ended up making some new friendships that will last well beyond the conference.</p>

<h6>Marty Bauer from <em><a href="https://www.ridepost.com/">RidePost</a></em></h6>

<p>Being at GAN allowed us to not only connect with other companies and founders but also expand the reach of our own product. Introducing it to new faces cannot be understated.</p>

<p>The three days in Boston were a good way for our company to step back and appreciate the process of being part of The Iron Yard. The mentors are invaluable and the additional perks are helpful. But the true value of The Iron Yard and other GAN accelerators is the unique opportunity to spend 3 months heads down with a singular focus on product development. The startup capital and co-work space creates a cocoon to focus only on building something great. In the end though it is still on us as founders to make the most of the time and opportunity.</p>

<p>Being at GAN in Boston gave us perspective of where The Iron Yard stacks up today to other accelerators and where we are heading in the future.</p>

<p><em>Dang Marty. We&rsquo;re blushing.</em></p>

<h6>John Krebsbach from <em><a href="https://www.shopwithspent.com/">Spent</a></em></h6>

<p>I thought the GAN conference was great. I enjoyed the opportunity to meet fellow founders. As peers, we have much to share and learn from one another from pitching and funding to product development and marketing. The atmosphere they struck at the conference encouraged candid and helpful conversations.</p>

<p>GAN also did a great job in structuring the conference to encourage networking. Having people rotate tables each topic discouraged people from falling into the age old trap of sitting with people they already know. The discussion time after speakers also got people talking and enabled me to form natural connections with other attendees. I&rsquo;m looking forward to attending more GAN events in the future.</p>

<h6>And here are a few thoughts from yours truly:</h6>

<p><strong>1) People in the startup space are awesome human beings</strong>
I&rsquo;m fairly new to startup world, and this conference was my first fully immersive experience. Almost every single person I met was really smart, really interesting, and really open. Lots of them were also hilarious, as we found out at Ignite. (An extremely witty Frenchman <a href="http://alphadesigner.com/mapping-stereotypes/">used these maps</a> in his talk on doing business abroad.) I&rsquo;ll take all of that I can get.</p>

<p><strong>2) There was great practical advice on getting visibility for your company</strong>
Both <a href="http://twitter.com/elaineellis">Elaine Ellis</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisRocheDC">Chris Roche</a> gave great reminders that the fundamentals of a good communications plan are pretty simple.</p>

<p>Elaine on social media: <em>&ldquo;Your time is more valuable than the number of social media channels you&rsquo;re on. Be picky, and let Google Analytics be your guide in showing you where to invest your time. And most importantly, don&rsquo;t push content out on social media just to push it out. If you&rsquo;re not proud of it, don&rsquo;t publish it.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Chris gave us a really great pathway to follow for PR:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> What&rsquo;s my story?</p></li>
<li><p> Where do I want to tell it?</p></li>
<li><p> Who do I want to tell it to?</p></li>
<li><p> Find those writers and publications, and start by building relationships with them.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Both emphasized the fact that developing ongoing relationships with journalists was essential to coverage &ndash; you&rsquo;ll rarely ever be successful if your first contact with a writer is a pitch.</p>

<p><strong>3) Seth Godin is really, really smart</strong>
And he&rsquo;s really nice. I mean, he seemed really nice from the stage &ndash; he was one of the most thankful, considerate speakers I&rsquo;ve seen. Here are the two things that stuck out as I reviewed my notes from his talk:</p>

<p>First was the idea of gifts VS attitudes VS skills. Almost every single quality you want in someone that you are going to hire is either an attitude or a skill. Further, attitudes can be taught, meaning they are a skill in some sense. The lesson? Get out of the mindset that you can hire some sort of specially gifted guru &ndash; people who are humble, willing to learn, and willing to work hard make the best hires and biggest impact on your company.</p>

<p>Second was the concept of building impetus to share into your product from the beginning. Seth said something along the lines of, &ldquo;Build in a reason for people to share what you make. Build the story into your app &ndash; make it work better if your friends use it. If you don&rsquo;t do that, you drastically decrease the chances of your product being found.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>4) I want to be Saul Colt (kind of)</strong>
I&rsquo;ll guarantee one thing: no one who attended his talk forgot Mr. Saul Colt. The guy is crazy, and brilliant. And he wanted everyone to know how good of a lover he was. And he sent mustard to a rival marketer. (Yes, it was that weird.)</p>

<p>Joking aside, I used to work in marketing, and far and away it&rsquo;s the best speech on the subject I&rsquo;ve ever seen. He presented a flash flood of wacky, ingenius and cost effective ideas he&rsquo;s implemented for companies over the years &ndash; and the results of how well they worked. Here are some one liners that stuck out to me:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Taking it one step too far is what people remember</p></li>
<li><p>But, you have to know where the line is with your customers &ndash; you have to cross it just enough, and not too much</p></li>
<li><p>If you can&rsquo;t compete, change the rules</p></li>
<li><p>Know, like, trust (if you know someone, like them, and then trust them, you will talk about them)</p></li>
<li><p>Promoting product features rarely works. Companies need stories, loyalty, and focus on people being excited about being part of a community, not a transactional relationship</p></li>
<li><p>The more connected you are with your customers, the better you will know what they want. But even more import than that is the more you know your customers, the more you will try not to disappoint them</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Bonus: One really good and one really awkward picture of The Iron Yard Team</h4>

<p>GAN took an awesome shot of Peter (our Managing Director). Look at that grin.
<a href="http://blog.theironyard.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/306031_546379725375993_1071726011_n-e1354032621558.jpeg"><img src="http://blog.theironyard.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/306031_546379725375993_1071726011_n-e1354032621558.jpeg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>They also took a picture of me making some sort of weird chicken-wing-flapping motion. Flattering.<br/>

        <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>South Carolina traditionally has struggled to garner as much venture capital as densely urban, high-tech areas, such as Austin, Boston, New York City or Silicon Valley.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>But one Silicon Valley investor has taken notice of Greenville, and a few Palmetto State startups have attracted capital recently.</strong></p>

<p>–GSA Business, <a href="http://www.gsabusiness.com/news/45945-venture-capitalists-take-a-peek-at-s-c">Venture capitalists take a peek at S.C.</a></p>

<p>South Carolina is attracting capital, and we&rsquo;re incredibly excited to be on the front lines.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.morgenthaler.com/">Morganthaler Ventures</a> invested $14 million in Charleston-based <a href="http://peoplematter.com/">PeopleMatter</a> earlier this year, and Kleiner Perkins has invested in two Greenville, SC companies, including <a href="http://www.proterra.com/index.php">Proterra</a>.</p>

<p>GSA Business, a local publication, <a href="http://www.gsabusiness.com/news/45945-venture-capitalists-take-a-peek-at-s-c">also says that</a> in order to attract more capital, _&ldquo;Companies and regions can up their chances of securing out-of-state venture capital. <strong>Regions need to focus on creating technology hubs</strong>, such as Charleston’s Digital Corridor or Greenville’s manufacturing hub of international companies.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The regions also need to <strong>cultivate a skilled workforce, business community support and quality of life</strong>,&rdquo; venture capital executives said._</p></blockquote>

<p>The Iron Yard is doing just that, and we&rsquo;ve got exciting news around the corner. Stay tuned.</p>

You probably don&rsquo;t think about fish related startups either. Shame on you.</p>

<p>So, in honor of this day of recognition, and neglected startups, and (mostly) because we&rsquo;re weird and like to have fun, we did a round of of fish focused startups.</p>

        <div class="entry-content"><h4><em>How CoWork is taking over the world with adjustable height standing desks.</em></h4>

<p>Sometime last year a bunch of us at CoWork decided we were tired of sitting on our asses – literally. The <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/05/ditch-your-office-chair-for-a-new-standing-desk/">standing desk movement</a> was taking off and we kept hearing about all the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/katetaylor/2012/08/02/can-standing-desks-fight-sitting-disease/">benefits of standing</a> on your feet for a good part of the day. So we set out to find the best desk for the least amount of money, and <em><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=adjustable+height+standing+desks&amp;oq=adjustable+height+standing+desks&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=adjustable+height+standing+desks&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=shop&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xohtUM-3GYi-9QStqYGoBQ&amp;ved=0CLwBELMY&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=c7e0ada04410524b&amp;biw=1570&amp;bih=1202">holy world of crappy weird geek desks</a></em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.theironyard.com/2012/11/its-time-to-take-a-stand-cowork-standing-desks/desk-chair/"><img src="http://blog.theironyard.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/desk-chair.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>At CoWork, we pride ourselves in being stuffy design punks, er, opinionated designers. Given that, we weren&rsquo;t about to go cubicle and get desks that should make a grown man cry. I&rsquo;m pretty sure every time <a href="http://desks.dallasmidwest.com/Adjustable-Height-Hi-Lo-Carrel-45-57-J10059-Zoom.aspx">this one</a> was built somewhere in China they kill a puppy. So like the pioneering design freaks we are, we set out to make our standing desks. We knew we wanted something industrial and cool that had adjustable height, which is an important part of using a standing desk.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d seen some of the great <a href="http://www.simplifiedbuilding.com/blog/sit-stand-work-desk-for-the-grain-mortar-studio/">projects</a> on <a href="http://www.simplifiedbuilding.com/">Simplified Building</a> and I knew that we could do something similar. I reached out to <a href="http://sim.plified.com/">Chris Pollock</a> who runs SBC and he was so excited about our project that they decided to discount the <a href="http://www.simplifiedbuilding.com/store/components.html">Kee Klamp</a> parts we needed for the desks. We designed our approach for the desks, bought the iron pipe and table tops (parts list below), and got to work! You&rsquo;ll see what an extremely safe and very serious group we are. We never drink beer on the job, and rarely join in any jocularity. Observe:</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/48556381">CoWork Greenville standing desks</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/lrbrain">Left Brain, Right Brain</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<h6>Parts List</h6>

<p>Everything total should cost you around $500. More than a crappy desk, less than something you can buy.</p>

        <div class="entry-content"><p>South Carolina seems like an odd place to be luring entrepreneurs and launching startups. That is until you visit &ndash; our quality of life in the upstate wows travelers from around the country (most recently a few editors from TechCrunch).<strong> But that&rsquo;s not the whole story. </strong></p>

<p>Area Development just <a href="http://www.areadevelopment.com/Top-States-for-Doing-Business/Fall2012/Strong-Business-Labor-Climat-South-Carolina-789932.shtml">ranked South Carolina #2 overall</a> in the best places to do business&hellip;in the country. An excerpt from the article is below, but first, a celebration is in order. SC, we&rsquo;re proud of you and proud to be a part of what&rsquo;s going on. Cheers.</p>

<p><em>From the ranking report:</em></p>

<blockquote><p>South Carolina is on a roll — the Palmetto State brought in a total investment of $3.37 billion from new and expanding businesses in 2011. Manufacturing is also on the mend, with total exports up by 21 percent last year. These are just some of the reasons South Carolina was ranked second by the consultants among the Top States for Doing Business, up from fourth place in 2011.</p></blockquote>

<p>The consultants also ranked South Carolina second for its overall business environment and overall labor climate (tied) because of its competitive labor costs and leading work force development programs. This is a result of the state’s pro-active approach to building a ready and willing work force that provides the advanced skill sets companies need for their new operations. ReadySC, South Carolina’s work force development program, has trained more than 250,000 workers for nearly 2,000 companies.</p>

          </p>
        
        <div class="entry-content"><p>We love how technology is helping people solve such a wide variety of problems. There really is an app for that, whether it&rsquo;s shortening your commute or streamlining your grocery list. Things get really exciting when the problem has a higher impact, like food allergies.</p>

<p>BetaKit <a href="http://betakit.com/2012/10/13/have-a-food-allergy-or-intolerance-theres-an-app-for-that">recently featured a series of apps</a> that &ldquo;help people achieve some degree of normalcy when it comes to living with their food allergies, food intolerances and dietary choices,&rdquo; and Iron Yard alum <a href="http://www.shopwithspent.com">Spent</a> was part of that mix.</p>

<p>How is Spent fighting food allergies? <a href="http://betakit.com/2012/10/13/have-a-food-allergy-or-intolerance-theres-an-app-for-that">From the article</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Startup <a href="http://www.shopwithspent.com">Spent</a> is also looking to connect people with food that suits their needs in a more general way. The platform is available on both iOS and Android and allows users to receive customized deals on groceries. <strong>Users with food allergies or intolerances can create a personalized deal feed, and are then only shown and sent deals that are suitable to their allergies and/or correlate with their past purchases</strong>.</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Fast Company Feature! Andria Trivisonno of Spent gives Practical Advice as a Female Entrepreneur</h2>

<time datetime="2012-10-19T11:48:21-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 19<span>th</span>, 2012</time>
            
          </p>
        
        <div class="entry-content"><p>Did you know that male entrepreneurs outnumbered women 3.5 to 1 between 1994 and 2010, and only 4% of founder applicants to YCombinator are women? Fast Company published those facts and others <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3002241/practical-advice-female-entrepreneurs-who-stand-out-sea-dudes?partner=newsletter">in an article</a> that declares of the startup universe: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still a man&rsquo;s world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The trend is beginning to change, though, and at The Iron Yard we&rsquo;re proud to be a part of it. One of our alumni teams, <a href="http://www.shopwithspent.com">Spent</a>, has a super-awesome female co-founder named Andria Trivisonno.</p>

<p>Andria recently joined a handful of other female founders to share &ldquo;a few ways women entrepreneurs say they&rsquo;ve tackled the particular challenges they face in the startup world.&rdquo; Here thoughts are quoted below, but be sure to <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3002241/practical-advice-female-entrepreneurs-who-stand-out-sea-dudes?partner=newsletter">read the full article here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote><h3>Stand Out</h3></blockquote>

<p>Andria Trivisonno is learning how to leverage being in the minority. Now in her sophomore entrepreneurial venture with Spent, a platform for retailers to send targeted recommendations to shoppers, she was one of only two female cofounders participating in the recent Iron Yard accelerator program in Greenville, S.C.; her business partner Terry Horner is a guy.</p>

<p>“I stand out a little more,” she says. “I like it.” That’s why Trivisonno was the one heading to Silicon Valley to drum up interest for Spent. She says, “If I email someone, it’s not coming from just another man.”</p>

<p>She’s not afraid to buck the techies’ dress code of hoodies and jeans, either. “I want to show my personality and I like fashion,” she says of her choice to wear skirts and heels to meetings and presentations. “But I want to get noticed for what I say, not what I’m wearing,” she adds. That’s why Trivisonno says she’s learned to show her passion for her work. “Don’t let underlying fear drive you. Push past it. Everyone is trying to prove themselves.”</p>

<time datetime="2012-10-16T11:29:24-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 16<span>th</span>, 2012</time>

        <div class="entry-content"><p>One of our teams (<a href="http://www.pathwright.com/">Pathwright</a>) just launched an amazing <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pathwrightpress/the-lamp-post-guild">Kickstarter campagin</a> called &ldquo;The Lamp Post Guild.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This project forges a unique marriage between online technology and the age-old offline craft of drawing. It will lead participants through three courses that teach &ldquo;<em>professional illustration to aspiring artists and help them make a living doing what they love.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Read the full story below, and don&rsquo;t forget to <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pathwrightpress/the-lamp-post-guild">back the project</a>.</p>

<p><em>Congrats to the Pathwright crew: Mark, Paul, Greg, and Justin. Great work guys!</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Every kid drew pictures until someone told them they couldn’t. Millions of people wanted to become artists when they grew up, but they were told that being an artist is not a &ldquo;real job.&rdquo; Only a few of them will actually make it as professional artists. It doesn&rsquo;t have to end this way.</p>

<p>We want to make this story end differently for these aspiring illustrators and artists by teaching online courses that will help them improve their craft and earn a living doing what they love.</p>

<p>We need your help to launch the first three courses that will form the beginning of an online art school called The Lamp Post Guild.<strong> In each of these courses, we&rsquo;ll teach high-level concepts and step-by-step processes that will help you think and work like a professional illustrator.</strong> As professional illustrators ourselves, we’ve learned these things the hard way and want to pass that knowledge on to you at a price you won’t have to go into debt for.</p>

<p>Each online course will include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A clear path of step-by-step lessons to complete at your own pace</p></li>
<li><p>High-quality video demonstrations of techniques and concepts</p></li>
<li><p>Digital resources and art assets to help with your projects (Photoshop brushes, textures, reference artwork, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunities to share your work and receive critique from your class</p></li>
<li><p>Carefully chosen readings related to the course topic</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunities to discuss technique and concepts with your class</p></li>
<li><p>A signed certificate of completion once you&rsquo;ve finished the course</p></li>
<li><p>Lifetime access to the course content</p></li>
<li><p>Our goals are to make these courses affordable (wer&#8217;e thinking $99-$150) and available to anyone in the world.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Note: <em>By supporting this project on Kickstarter, you can get early, priority access to the courses for yourself or you may gift the courses to a friend or family member!</em></p>

<p>&lt; bow to your sensei ></p>

<p>Mason Stewart and a handful of rockin&#8217; volunteers are launching <a href="http://coderdojogreenville.com">CoderDojo: Greenville</a> &ndash; a place where young people will learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and more. On top of the courses, they&rsquo;ll tour tech companies, bring in guest speakers, and host fun events for participants. The Iron Yard is excited to be hosting these courses for talented youngsters at our Greenville location (in the NEXT Center).</p>

<p>The first round of classes will be held <strong>every Tuesday 6pm to 7:30pm, October 2 &ndash; November 6</strong>, 2012. Mason is going to be teaching the first 6 weeks in a language called <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> (developed by MIT). If you haven&rsquo;t ever used it, it&rsquo;s actually super fun for adults.</p>

<p>Make sure to <a href="http://coderdojogreenville.com/signup">visit the signup page</a> if you’re interested in attending. Spots are available for kids 8 to 18 years old, and because of limited seating they can’t take walk-ins &ndash; <em>make sure to get a ticket first</em>!</p>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t tell already, Mason and his crew have a big heart for helping kids work towards great careers, great relationships with their peers, and real involvement with their communities.</p>

<p>If you have that same big heart, you can get involved too. Visit the <a href="http://coderdojogreenville.com/volunteer">CoderDojo FAQ</a> or <a href="mailto:mason@coderdojogreenville.com?Subject=I'm%20interested%20in%20CoderDojo%20Greenville!">email Mason Stewart</a> for more info.</p>
