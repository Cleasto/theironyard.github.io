<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s get going.</p>

<p><strong>1) This week we&rsquo;re thinking about online privacy.</strong> If you haven&rsquo;t seen Tom Scott&rsquo;s <a href="http://actualfacebookgraphsearches.tumblr.com/">collection of Facebook Graph searches</a>, you should. Here&rsquo;s a teaser:</p>

<blockquote><p>Graph Search jokes are a good way of startling people into checking their privacy settings — but most people will never actually be affected by accidentally making data ‘public’. (Of course, for the unlucky ones, it won’t be a gamble worth taking.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Most of the danger online comes not from strangers making half-assed joke searches: it comes from people who know you. A lot of the public data fails what I call the ‘bitter ex test’: can someone who hates you ruin your life with that information?</p>

        <h2>Getting to Their Level: Teaching Kids to Code</h2>
        
          <p class="meta">
            








  


<time datetime="2013-01-31T16:18:34-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 31<span>st</span>, 2013</time>
            
          </p>
        
        <div class="entry-content"><p>_This is an amazing story from one of our <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/academy/kids">CoderDojo</a> instructors about teaching kids to code.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard, we teach Scratch, HTML/CSS/JS, and electronics programming to over 70 kids each week. For free. (Also, we just <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/academy/the-iron-yard-academy">launched applications</a> for our intensive 3-month front end development course.)_</p>

<hr />

<p>Bradley* working on his white belt [completing the introductory Scratch course]. This past week, the instructor announced a new project where a wizard and a dragon talked to each other. “To make this happen” , he said, “we are going to use a list. “Now”, he went on, “when you put stuff into the list, the dragon will hear it and then do come cool stuff.” Bradley was ecstatic and fixed his eyes on the projection from the instructor’s computer that was showing the code. “Go ahead and put a wizard and a dragon on your stage and name them”, he said. Bradley had not seen either of these two characters before so it took him a while to find them. He had not named a character before, so that took some time too. He is a one finger typer. But he got it all set up.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the instructor had placed a control on the script panel for the dragon that was a listener for the list. Bradley saw this and did the same. The instructor said, “It doesn’t’ matter what you call it.” So, Bradley typed in “abracadabra” one letter at a time into the listener. He then added the controls that the instructor had put up on the screen to activate the dragon.</p>

<p>Bradley tried to run it. Nothing happened. He got frustrated and came over to me and said, “It doesn’t work.”  So, the two of us walked back to his computer. I said, “Show me.” Bradley, looking very seriously at the screen, leaned in and said, “abracadabra”.  Nothing happened.  …what do you say?</p>

<p>Granted, Bradley is young but he has seen a lot of technology and it is not outside the possibility that when the instructor started talking about “listening” and “talking” that he expect to be able to talk to his character. <strong>As programmers, we have commandeered so many words and given them our own special meaning.  As teachers, we must try to think like our students and bring them into our vocabulary.  Think about these words as English words not programming words:  loop, listen or event. Even the word “code” has a meaning other than a computer program.</strong></p>

<p>And remember, the next time you tell a kid, you are going to talk to a dragon, he is going to believe you.</p>

        <div class="entry-content"><p>_At the end of 2012, we were lucky enough to get an email from a guy named Kevin Crace. He was finishing up at Boston Startup School after crushing through an architecture degree from <a href="http://www.risd.edu/">RISD</a>, all before he made it through age 25. If that wasn&rsquo;t enough, he&rsquo;s done great freelance work for startups like <a href="http://www.promoboxx.com/">Promoboxx</a> and <a href="http://dashbell.com/">Dashbell</a>. Turns out he&rsquo;s passionate about the Southeast, and he wanted help out at The Iron Yard. We&rsquo;ve already gotten his hands dirty with Iron Yard design projects, and we can&rsquo;t wait to see the incredible stuff he does for our startups. _</p>

<p>Meet Kevin:</p>

<p>A quick hello from your friendly neighborhood designer-in-residence,</p>

<p>So here I am in Greenville, SC by way of Boston and I gotta say that I am loving it, <em>y’all</em>. I just wrapped up with <a href="http://bostonstartupschool.com/">Boston Startup School</a> where I was submerged in all things startup. I learned the lingo, the series, the culture fit, the hugs, and the sweat equity, but most importantly I learned about risk.</p>

<p>After rapidly building a network in Boston and meeting with many fresh startups, I realized how much community is valued. I decided to take a risk and leave Boston for a community I feel rooted to and a community I want to see thrive. I am thrilled to be a part of The Iron Yard because they have the same value and drive.  We’re here to see the Upstate thrive and to weave in rich pockets of tech and design.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to get my design hands dirty with the companies coming through the accelerator. I am eager to be a sponge for each mentor that walks in (call me SpongeBob Khaki Pants) and I am ready to immerse myself in the startup world of the Carolinas.</p>

<p>Here we go (high fives all around)!</p>

        <div class="entry-content"><p>We use Asana to manage projects and track to-do&rsquo;s for our team. Their web app is wonderful, but their non-native iPhone app has a lot of users <a href="http://blog.asana.com/2012/09/our-iphone-app-levels-up/">begging for offline functionality</a>.</p>

<p>I was one of them, and as I Googled around for news and information, I ran across a <a href="http://www.quora.com/Asana/Why-is-it-taking-months-for-Asana-to-deliver-a-native-mobile-app-with-offline-support">really smart post on Quora</a> about the decision process Asana faces in creating a mobile app that works offline, while maintaining a user experience congruent with their web app.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great reminder of how hard building awesome stuff actually is:</p>

<blockquote><p>Straying from simplicity is a challenge all non-trivial apps have to solve at some point in order to deliver amazing value to their users. Apple is currently facing many of the same type of issues with iCloud. How do you tame power and simplicity in one neat swoop?</p></blockquote>

<p>This is where magic comes in. <strong>Magic is when a piece of software does something you did not think was possible in a way that is so elegant and seamless that you can&rsquo;t feel there&rsquo;s any other way things could (nor should) work.</strong> Writing on the same document at the same time in Google Docs. Finding friends on Facebook (make no mistake, a tremendous bit of engineering goes into this). Buying and installing an app on your phone.</p>

<p>Complexity made simple. In a way, this is the challenge Asana has set itself from the start. Turning human organizations into efficient creation and delivery organisms is a tremendous task.</p>

<p>Related: a great quote <a href="http://blog.theironyard.com/2012/12/lazy-friday-links-vol-2/">we posted</a> from <a href="http://www.elezea.com/2012/12/maybe-it-doesnt-suck/">Rian van der Merwe</a>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>It’s easy to write a few paragraphs about how much something sucks. You know what’s difficult? Recognizing and respecting complexity. Giving people the benefit of the doubt and trying to understand why they made the decisions they made — whether it’s related to business, design, development, or anything else.</em>&rdquo;</p>

        <div class="entry-content"><p>We&rsquo;re really passionate about the power of coworking around here. So much so, in fact, that we&rsquo;re growing from one location to three this year. It turns out that our passion is really good for us and our work, too.</p>

<p>Fast Company recently published an article about the benefits of coworking. Here&rsquo;s a snippet:</p>

<blockquote><p>Even if you aren’t an entrepreneur or freelancer, the benefits of coworking, according to Deskmag’s annual Global Coworking Survey, are pretty hard to ignore: 71 percent of participants reported a boost in creativity since joining a coworking space, while 62 percent said their standard of work had improved.</p></blockquote>

<p>And what do you know&hellip;The Iron Yard got a mention, too:</p>

<blockquote><p>Dodd Caldwell, founder of Loft Resumes and MoonClerk, has been coworking for two and a half years in Greenville, S.C. Most recently, he’s sharing space with other startups at Iron Yard. “We&rsquo;re a pretty curated coworking space, so even though we&rsquo;re made up of different companies, we&rsquo;re all fairly kindred spirits,” Caldwell asserts. By running his small businesses in a curated coworking space, he says, “I get the advantages of the culture of a medium-size business without having to deal with most of the downsides that come with it, like bureaucracy.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A taste to whet your palette:</p>
