    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<hr />

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, everyone. We still exist.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been exactly 55 days of radio silence on our blog, but we have really good excuses (and a few not-so-good ones).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><em>(You&rsquo;ll notice that all hyperlinks are at the bottom of the post. Here&rsquo;s why<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.)</em></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been up to:</p>

<h4>Heavy duty work on our website</h4>

<p>You may have noticed a few color and style changes around the site, but those are only symptoms of deep re-constructive surgery. Mason originally built our site as a Ruby app running Active Admin (a GUI for managing content) and we&rsquo;ve been <em>really</em> busy transitioning the entire system to run on a platform called Jekyll.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> (We&rsquo;ll detail all of the nerdy stuff in a future post.)</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, yours truly has been spending some quality time with code in the last few months.</p>

<h4>Moving our Greenville offices, again.</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;re back in our original offices space at the NEXT Innovation Center. (Mason and I accomplished 90% of the move in 12 hours by ourselves. It was a long day.) Several amazing CoWorkers are in our space, and we&rsquo;re enjoying the fresh take on our old digs.</p>

<h4>Sprinting with our Digital Health accelerator teams</h4>

<p>Our latest accelerator class has been running tirelessly towards their October 2nd Demo Day in at the Health 2.0 Conference in San Francisco. If you&rsquo;re in the Bay area, be sure to come to their pitch session. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Our class has made incredible progress. James Rogers, head of Mayo Clinic Ventures was just in town to spend time with our teams and check out everything happening at The Iron Yard. We couldn&rsquo;t do this without the support of our mentors.</p>

<h4>Making some exciting changes to our Open Tech accelerator</h4>

<p>Stay tuned for more info soon. 2014 is going to be an awesome year.</p>

<h4>Doubling the size of our Front End Engineering class in the Academy</h4>

<p><img src="http://theironyard.com/images/blog/2013/09/9.19.13/fee-class-august-2013.jpg" style="border-radius: 3px;"></p>

<p>The size of our flagship Academy class, Front End Engineering, more than doubled this semester. In the process of managing growth, Mason and I have been pulling out all of the stops and making the <em>experience</em> of class as good as the curriculum. More details in a future post. Also, applications for our January class are open, but it&rsquo;s filling up.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<h4>Offering all sorts of new courses through the Academy</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;re expanding our subject matter. So far we&rsquo;ve worked on material for Ruby on Rails, iOS development, mobile app design, design fundamentals, and digital productivity. You can always find a list of current classes on our website.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<h4>Teaching even more kids to code</h4>

<p>CoderDojo is back in action running two nights per week, one class on Scratch and one class on Electronics. We&rsquo;ve also started after school programs that will cover more advanced subjects including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, Racket, and advanced electronics.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<h4>Planning for Grok 2014</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;re already working on details for Grok 2014, and we&rsquo;ll announce ticket sales soon.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<h4>Drawing on the walls</h4>

<p>Our students—kids and adults—love writing on our whiteboard walls. Here&rsquo;s a particularly awesome drawing of a dragon wearing a fanny pack.</p>

<p>Text riddled with hyperlinks isn&rsquo;t good for your brain.
