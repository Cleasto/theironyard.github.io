<p>2013 has been a pretty amazing year. As we look back on what the past 12 months have been for The Iron Yard as a company, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine all that&rsquo;s been accomplished. We&rsquo;ve run two accelerator programs, watching successful startups dig their heels in to build amazing products and raise funding. We&rsquo;ve also seen people alter the course of their life by learning to code in our Academy. We&rsquo;re both humbled and very excited about what is to come.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Naturally, with more attention comes growth and we&rsquo;ve started looking at expanding our presence into the surrounding areas -GSA Business recently published some of our high-level plans for expansion<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and we have some really exciting news about about our team:</p>

<p><strong>We&rsquo;ve just hired John Saddington<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> to help us grow our Academy</strong>.<br/>
(We&rsquo;re hiring more people, too.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>)</p>

<p>Hailing from Atlanta, John comes to us with a wealth of experience from both the enterprise and startup worlds. As a serial entrepreneur he&rsquo;s actually mentored many of our cohorts in the past few years and knows our culture inside and out. He&rsquo;s also an accomplished hacker. As a Partner he&rsquo;ll help develop company-wide strategic initiatives as well as grow the Atlanta Academy next year. We&rsquo;re flattered that he said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; when we pinged him about jumping on board.</p>

<p>So, officially:</p>

<blockquote><p>Welcome to the team, John! 2014 is going to be an amazing year.</p></blockquote>

<em>Jen Ngetich, Class of April &lsquo;13</em></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been teaching programming and hardware hacking to kids for almost a year now at The Iron Yard, and the students have been a wonderful mix of girls and boys, from a wide range of economic, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds. Through flat-out-free classes and full scholarships for paid classes, we&rsquo;ve tried to make sure that any child with even a modicum of curiosity has a chance to learn programming.</p>

<p>On many occasions, the mothers, older sisters, and aunts of our students have expressed that they wish programs like ours had existed years ago. Many women we&rsquo;ve spoken to were <em>directly discouraged</em> from STEM when they were younger, being told, &ldquo;engineering is for men.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Making tech a more welcoming environment for <em>everyone</em> is a cause we support wholeheartedly, and we&rsquo;re working to make that vision reality.</p>

<p><strong>As our first effort, I&rsquo;m thrilled to announce that next semester we&rsquo;re offering two women a $1500 scholarship towards our Front End Engineering class in January</strong>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>In addition to the normal student application, those seeking scholarships will be asked to write a brief essay (600 words) on how they plan to help promote women in tech (the application link is at the end of the post). <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re incredibly proud of all of our students and graduates and the contributions they&rsquo;ve already made to make tech more welcoming and accessible in our community.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t wait to continue the tradition next semester with a focus on women in tech.</p>

    <id>http://theironyard.com/blog/2013/10/17/the-little-freelancer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<hr />

<p>Have you ever done freelance or contract work? If so, do you remember the excitement and fear at the beginning of your journey? How about your first client? Your first big check?</p>

<p>Realizing you are your own boss is greatâ€”you get to set your own schedule, choose the tools you use, and (hopefully) make way more money than you did in your junior-level 9-5 gig.</p>

<p>But, as may have discovered, it&rsquo;s not that simple.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Do you remember the feeling in your gut the first time you got an email from an upset client? Or way underquoted a project and realized you brought home a whopping $4/hr?</p>

<p>Discovering the hard parts of freelancing is an extremely discouraging experience and has made for lots of unhappy workers and clients.</p>

<p>Much of this pain is unnecessary. Sure, not everyone is cut out to work for themselves, but for most people even a little bit of guidance can significantly flatten the learning curve and build the foundation for a great career.</p>

<p>Several current students (and graduates) in our Front End Engineering course are pursuing freelance, so over the past week I&rsquo;ve been developing curriculum that will help them learn the ropes and not repeat the many mistakes I made early on.</p>

<p>The notes for a few lectures turned into sizable guide, and we decided to <a href="https://github.com/ericdodds/the-little-freelancer">open source the whole thing</a>. It&rsquo;s called <strong>The Little Freelancer</strong>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>We hope it will make lots of freelancers and their clients happy. We also hope people smarter than us will contribute to it.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a snippet from the first section:</p>

<blockquote><h4>Welcome to customer service</h4>

<p>This guide covers practical advice ranging from your first client meeting to self employment taxes. Before we get there, though, we want to remind you of something <strong>really</strong> important:</p>

<p><strong><em>The way you treat people will always be more important than the work you do.</em></strong></p>

<p>There are incredibly talented programmers out there who are jerks and struggle to find work because people don&rsquo;t like being around them. There are also bad programmers who always have jobs because people like to work with them.</p>

<p>No matter what career you&rsquo;re going to pursue, writing good code is only the cost of entry. Your goal is to produce top-notch work <em>and</em> be someone that others want to work with.</p></blockquote>
