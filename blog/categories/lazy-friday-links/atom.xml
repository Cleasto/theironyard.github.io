<p>Yesterday we broke a 55 day streak of silence on the blog. That means Lazy Friday Links are back, baby.</p>

<p>Not sure what Lazy Friday Links are?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We started this end-of-the-week tradition to celebrate productivity by engaging in meaningless disctraction. Well, mostly. We include a single thought-provoking link (so we don&rsquo;t feel like complete slackers), and a healthy drink from distraction-filled ocean of internet weirdness. We used to put the heady stuff first, but we&rsquo;ll save that for last so you don&rsquo;t have to bother if you don&rsquo;t want to.</p>

<p><em>Also, as a sidenote, in yesterday&rsquo;s post, we mentioned that we&rsquo;re not going to sprinkle hyperlinks throughout our posts, forgoing the most common reference method for footnotes, like this.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Because Lazy Friday Links is all about distraction, we&rsquo;ll ignore that rule. But only on Fridays.</em></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s almost too much thinking already, so let&rsquo;s move onward to diversion.</p>

<p><strong>Number one</strong><br/>
Fifty-five minutes and fifteen seconds of <a href="https://vimeo.com/55006097">pure 80s televison gold</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Number two</strong><br/>
An amazing reel of NFL Kickoff footage <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1USHmMw2dI8#t=45">quoting a famous scene from <em>The Princess Bride</em></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Number three</strong><br/>
Bill Nye the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DrXpLu5.gif">science</a> guy.</p>

<p><strong>Number four</strong><br/>
A frighteningly well executed stopping of a car and arresting of its driver, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/i2Z85jB.jpg">through the winshield</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Number five (warning: requires thought)</strong><br/>
You might have noticed that technology has upended industry after industry in the last few years, and it&rsquo;s picking up speed. If you haven&rsquo;t noticed that, well, it&rsquo;s Friday. We can all be happy.</p>

<p>Adam Davidson <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/01/making-it-in-america/308844/">wrote a fascinating piece</a> exploring technology in manufacturing and how it affects jobs of workers in that industry. Here&rsquo;s a taste:</p>

<blockquote><p>The double shock we’re experiencing now—globalization and computer-aided industrial productivity—happens to have the opposite impact: income inequality is growing, as the rewards for being skilled grow and the opportunities for unskilled Americans diminish.</p>

<p>I went to South Carolina, and spent so much time with Maddie, precisely because these issues are so large and so overwhelming. I wanted to see how this shift affected regular people’s lives.</p></blockquote>

<p>Happy Friday. It&rsquo;s good to be back.</p>

<p>—Eric</p>

<p>Text riddled with hyperlinks isn&rsquo;t good for your brain. Here&rsquo;s a quote from a <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/05/ff_nicholas_carr/">WIRED piece</a> that details the science behind the issue: &ldquo;<em>Research continues to show that people who read linear text comprehend more, remember more, and learn more than those who read text peppered with links.</em>&rdquo; Again, we&rsquo;re ignoring this for Lazy Friday Links. <a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yeah, yeah, we didn&rsquo;t publish anything last week. We were launching a code school, for crying out loud.</p>

<p>Also, you&rsquo;ve probably noticed the lack of obese animal picture in the post. Sorry about that, but I couldn&rsquo;t bear scrolling through our blog because I realized it was one big stream of fat creature photos, so I took a week off.</p>

<p><strong>1) Along with launching a code school, we announced a product design class taught by Marco Suarez. </strong> <a href="https://medium.com/tech-talk/fce9d38d2290">He wrote an amazing post called &ldquo;The Gap&rdquo; about why we started a design school</a>. Here&rsquo;s a taste:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our mission is not to replace a formal education nor the need for online learning, but fill a gap that our shifting industry has created, train people for great jobs, and build meaningful projects in the process.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>1) There&rsquo;s been a ton of talk about startup communities with the release of Brad Feld&rsquo;s new book.</strong> So for today&rsquo;s Link With Actual Value™, we wanted to point you to a fascinating article called <a href="http://qz.com/3396/seeding-a-silicon-valley-how-poland-is-creating-a-startup-ecosystem-from-scratch/">Seeding a Silicon Valley: How Poland is creating a startup ecosystem from scratch</a>.</p>

<p>The author analyzes the good and bad of the <em>&ldquo;Billions of the EU dollars that pour into Poland each year&hellip;intended to promote entrepreneurship and innovation. As Warsaw rushes to dole out the cash, a startup boom has been born–but can state subsidies really act as seed capital, and what will happen when the EU turns off the spigots?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>1) ThinkLink: Startups are about fast, but accelerators actually slow you down. </strong> Our good friend Patrick Riley <a href="http://gan.co/blog/the-industry/why-accelerators-actually-slow-a-company-down-all-while-propelling-the-company-to-success">wrote an awesome post about how accelerators help slow your company down</a>, and how that is the best thing for you.</p>
