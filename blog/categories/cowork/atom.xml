<p>I won&rsquo;t lie: I think CoWorking in Greenville is about as good as it gets. Visitors from all over comment on our unique environment, and we&rsquo;re super thankful for all of the amazing people that make our work environments what they are. And we&rsquo;ve got more of a good thing coming soon:</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re adding two new locations this spring. In a few weeks we&rsquo;ll launch a space on Main Street in Downtown Greenville called &ldquo;The Forge,&rdquo; and by summer we&rsquo;ll be up and running in Spartanburg at &ldquo;The Mill.&rdquo; Both locations will house accelerator classes as well as CoWorking space. Our original location, known simply as CoWork, is now called &ldquo;Railside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In celebration, we wanted to invite you on a walk through the space that started it all, CoWork at Railside.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re really passionate about the power of coworking around here. So much so, in fact, that we&rsquo;re growing from one location to three this year. It turns out that our passion is really good for us and our work, too.</p>

<p>Fast Company recently published an article about the benefits of coworking. Here&rsquo;s a snippet:</p>

<blockquote><p>Even if you aren’t an entrepreneur or freelancer, the benefits of coworking, according to Deskmag’s annual Global Coworking Survey, are pretty hard to ignore: 71 percent of participants reported a boost in creativity since joining a coworking space, while 62 percent said their standard of work had improved.</p></blockquote>

<p>And what do you know&hellip;The Iron Yard got a mention, too:</p>

<blockquote><p>Dodd Caldwell, founder of Loft Resumes and MoonClerk, has been coworking for two and a half years in Greenville, S.C. Most recently, he’s sharing space with other startups at Iron Yard. “We&rsquo;re a pretty curated coworking space, so even though we&rsquo;re made up of different companies, we&rsquo;re all fairly kindred spirits,” Caldwell asserts. By running his small businesses in a curated coworking space, he says, “I get the advantages of the culture of a medium-size business without having to deal with most of the downsides that come with it, like bureaucracy.”</p></blockquote>

<h4><em>How CoWork is taking over the world with adjustable height standing desks.</em></h4>

<p>Sometime last year a bunch of us at CoWork decided we were tired of sitting on our asses – literally. The <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/05/ditch-your-office-chair-for-a-new-standing-desk/">standing desk movement</a> was taking off and we kept hearing about all the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/katetaylor/2012/08/02/can-standing-desks-fight-sitting-disease/">benefits of standing</a> on your feet for a good part of the day. So we set out to find the best desk for the least amount of money, and <em><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=adjustable+height+standing+desks&amp;oq=adjustable+height+standing+desks&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=adjustable+height+standing+desks&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=shop&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xohtUM-3GYi-9QStqYGoBQ&amp;ved=0CLwBELMY&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=c7e0ada04410524b&amp;biw=1570&amp;bih=1202">holy world of crappy weird geek desks</a></em>.</p>

<p>At CoWork, we pride ourselves in being stuffy design punks, er, opinionated designers. Given that, we weren&rsquo;t about to go cubicle and get desks that should make a grown man cry. I&rsquo;m pretty sure every time <a href="http://desks.dallasmidwest.com/Adjustable-Height-Hi-Lo-Carrel-45-57-J10059-Zoom.aspx">this one</a> was built somewhere in China they kill a puppy. So like the pioneering design freaks we are, we set out to make our standing desks. We knew we wanted something industrial and cool that had adjustable height, which is an important part of using a standing desk.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d seen some of the great <a href="http://www.simplifiedbuilding.com/blog/sit-stand-work-desk-for-the-grain-mortar-studio/">projects</a> on <a href="http://www.simplifiedbuilding.com/">Simplified Building</a> and I knew that we could do something similar. I reached out to <a href="http://sim.plified.com/">Chris Pollock</a> who runs SBC and he was so excited about our project that they decided to discount the <a href="http://www.simplifiedbuilding.com/store/components.html">Kee Klamp</a> parts we needed for the desks. We designed our approach for the desks, bought the iron pipe and table tops (parts list below), and got to work! You&rsquo;ll see what an extremely safe and very serious group we are. We never drink beer on the job, and rarely join in any jocularity. Observe:</p>

<h6>Parts List</h6>

<p>Everything total should cost you around $500. More than a crappy desk, less than something you can buy.</p>
