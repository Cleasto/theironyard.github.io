</p><p><em>This is a post from Marco Suarez explaining what we&rsquo;ve learned on the journey of starting an intensive design school.</em></p>

<p>There is a gap that is widening between the education students are receiving and the skills companies require. The most obvious disconnect is in software and technology. Universities fail to keep up and the proponents of an informal, self-taught education use that deficiency as their banner. But technology and software are platforms and tools. And just because you know how to use a tool doesn’t make you a craftsman. The more serious gap is in a person’s ability to think. Mobile touch platforms have radically changed the way we use technology, so much so that it has caused broad societal shift. The potential of this shift is fueling investors to pour insane amounts of money into people and ideas that take advantage of it. There is a need for designers who can think critically and creatively to solve real problems by utilizing these new platforms and tools.</p>

<p>And this is where The Iron Yard comes into the story. The Iron Yard is a company in the southeast that has set up residence at the gates of new tech ideation. And we saw an opportunity. We know software and technology really well and we know companies that are hiring. So we started an <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/education/academy/front-end-engineering">intensive front end engineering program</a> this year that is doing great. So great that we decided to spin up a <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/education/academy/product-design">design program</a> that focuses on digital product design. We’d teach the process of design thinking through building real applications for real people. We’d assess problems and build prototypes, brands, and interfaces for web and mobile. Sounded like a home run. So we thought.</p>

<p>The vast differences between teaching code and design &ndash; and recruiting students for each discipline &ndash; taught us a lot about the state of education. Teaching code is similar to teaching math—either you know it or you don’t. Design is different. It’s subjective. It assembles culture, metaphors, art, and taste with problems, challenges, and data. So you could say it is similar to teaching English. A lot of people think they’re good enough at English that they don’t need to further their learning of the language.</p>

<p>Another observation is the people in our front end engineering program didn’t have any previous experience with code, and they didn’t need to. After a month of class, they were as proficient as me and I’ve been doing this stuff for a decade. Kudos to their teacher, Mason Stewart. But our design program wasn’t a foundational design course. It was a higher learning program that would add another tool to their design toolbox. This changed our target market drastically. In the pool of designers, we were targeting those who wanted to shift out of designing consumables (websites, advertising, and marketing) to designing software for startups. So our task was to get our program in front of those people.</p>

<p>We tried some PR, social media, and whatever else but to no avail. And then we remembered <a href="/images/blog/2013/04/the-gap-or-why-we-started-a-design-course/">the gap</a>. Universities do a good job giving students a solid design foundation. They give students four years to get it wrong, experiment, and expand their minds. This was a foundation we could build on. So we scheduled some meetings with local universities and found an overwhelmingly positive response to what we were offering. Universities recognize where they’re falling short and supplementing their program with ours seemed like a match made in heaven. So we narrowed our focus to students. This is where it got interesting.</p>

<p>I assumed that this technologically saturated generation would be so starved for digital literacy that our program would be cool water to their lips. But I could not have been more wrong. These students all owned iPhones, Androids, and tablets and computers of all kinds. They’re all active users on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and all sorts of apps but none of them had ever thought they could work for one of these companies. When I mentioned that we would be learning to write some code, I completely lost them. At that point our class was not only foreign, it was intimidating. And who is going to sign away three months of their lives and a bunch of money to be intimidated and frustrated and then be placed in an ever more intimidating and frustrating job?</p>

<p>Two weeks away from the inaugural launch of our class, we had two signups. We approached students just weeks away from graduation about pretty much changing the trajectory of their career. Not such a good idea. In order to create action you have to first reveal the need for action. And we were asking these students to act before they fully realized the need. We were a little overzealous. But we believe the greatest need for our program is in bridging the gap between universities and companies.And now that we know our target market, we can form a plan that entices students early on, accommodates their schedules and budgets, and place them in jobs where they can fully utilize their minds and their knowledge of software and technology.</p>

<p>We’re working out ideas like one day classes on Saturdays, classes that fit into a normal semester, and the summer long intensive program with a guaranteed job placement. Whatever the end product looks like, the need is growing, and The Iron Yard is passionate about training the next generation of great designers.</p>
