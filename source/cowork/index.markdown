![People working at The Iron Yard](https://theironyard.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/image_asset/storage/225/cowork-greenville-railside-600.jpg)

Our Coworking spaces are comprised of designers, strategists, developers, writers and entrepreneurs. We’re not talking about fly-by-night freelancers. They’re independent business owners, connected with each other through the space they share and the projects they inevitably develop together.

### Cutting edge coworking in South Carolina, you say?

The place you live in tells a story and we like the story that Upstate SC tells. Certainly, every member of CoWork, at some point, has lived in or toyed with the idea of the “big city.” But we thrive on the small-town aesthetic of our area, the cultivated local art scenes, and quality people just like ourselves. Come take a look for yourself.

### CoWork Pricing

**1. Drop in - Pay by tip.**
Just come on in with your laptop and use the great wifi and hangout in an amazing space where work gets done. You can tip The Iron Yard with the [Venmo](http://venmo.com/) app if you’d like. Come around anytime. Once you start using CoWork regularly you can update to a Cafe Membership. _**Hours: 9am-5pm**_

**2. Cafe Member - $100/mo.**
Use the wifi. Get to be a part of our community. Sit where there is open space. Pay month to month or recurring – it’s your choice. Get serious about your productivity and get out of the house! _**Hours: 9am-5pm**_

**3. Full Time Member - $300/mo.**
Get wired up or use the wifi. Get a desk to call your own where you can put your weird little domukans and a big ‘ol mac display. Become part of the one of the most talented communities of designers, developers, entrepreneurs, writers, and makers in the United States. _**Hours: 24hrs**_
