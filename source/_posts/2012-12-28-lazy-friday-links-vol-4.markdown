Welcome back to the office. Today might not feel like a Friday because of the short week, but that's a horrible excuse for not procrastinating your way around the internet. And with that, here are your Lazy Friday Links: 

**1) In the spirit of both post-holiday shopping as well as dealings with VCs and Angels, today's Think Link is about negotiation.**.
Quartz ran a [great piece](http://qz.com/39074/how-to-negotiate-for-anything/) called "How to negotiate for anything" that includes an awesome story about a former FBI negotiator purchasing a car.

2) [Throwing boiling water off a balcony in Siberia when it's -41°](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LFtYUUXJlE).

3) A blue hand coming out of an old computer [feeding a lady a taco](http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr03/2012/12/3/10/anigif_enhanced-buzz-20788-1354549722-2.gif).

4) An awesome kid [dropping mad beats on a washing machine](http://devour.com/video/whirled-beat/).

Happy Friday.
