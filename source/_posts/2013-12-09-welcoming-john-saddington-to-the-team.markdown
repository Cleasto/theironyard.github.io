2013 has been a pretty amazing year. As we look back on what the past 12 months have been for The Iron Yard as a copmany, it's hard to imagine all that's been accomplished. We've run two accelerator programs, watching successful startups dig their heels in to build amazing products and raise funding. We've also seen people alter the course of their life by learning to code in our Academy. We're both humbled and very excited about what is to come.

<!--Naturally, success and attention drive growth, and we've started looking at expanding our presence into the surrounding areas. -->

<!-- more -->

Naturally, with more attention comes growth and we've started looking at expanding our presence into the surrounding areas -GSA Business recently published some of our high-level plans for expansion[^1], and we have some really exciting news about about our team: 

**We've just hired John Saddington[^2] to help us grow our Academy**.  
(We're hiring more people, too.[^3])

Hailing from Atlanta, John comes to us with a wealth of experience from both the enterprise and startup worlds. As a serial entrepreneur he's actually mentored many of our cohorts in the past few years and knows our culture inside and out. He's also an accomplished hacker. As a Partner he'll help develop company-wide strategic initiatives as well as grow the Atlanta Academy next year. We're flattered that he said "yes" when we pinged him about jumping on board. 

So, officially:

> Welcome to the team, John! 2014 is going to be an amazing year.
