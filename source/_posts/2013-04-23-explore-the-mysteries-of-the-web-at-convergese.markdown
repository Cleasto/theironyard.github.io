Woah, we almost forgot to mention one of our favorite conferences of the year, and [there's still time to sign up](https://account.unmatchedstyle.com/register/convergese-2013/)! 

ConvergeSE is one of the best web conferences on the map, in our humble opinion. One of the founders, Gene Crawford, is a mentor in our program. One of the best parts of Converge is the strict focus on specific subjects. This year they're tackling new territory in internet-old topics: 

<!-- more -->

**Design** - Explore the responsive design landscape, sharpen your prototyping design skills and explore web typography.

**Front End Development** - Dive into CSS with animations...Then get some in-depth experience exploring the responsive landscape.

**Mobile** - Explore RubyMotion and learn how to built apps with this revolutionary toolchain for iOS.

**Business and Marketing** - Take a look at branding yourself and learning to balance clients and products in your business.
