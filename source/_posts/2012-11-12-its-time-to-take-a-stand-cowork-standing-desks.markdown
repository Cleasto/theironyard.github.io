#### _How CoWork is taking over the world with adjustable height standing desks._


Sometime last year a bunch of us at CoWork decided we were tired of sitting on our asses – literally. The [standing desk movement](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/05/ditch-your-office-chair-for-a-new-standing-desk/) was taking off and we kept hearing about all the [benefits of standing](http://www.forbes.com/sites/katetaylor/2012/08/02/can-standing-desks-fight-sitting-disease/) on your feet for a good part of the day. So we set out to find the best desk for the least amount of money, and _[holy world of crappy weird geek desks](https://www.google.com/search?q=adjustable+height+standing+desks&oq=adjustable+height+standing+desks&sugexp=chrome,mod=0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=adjustable+height+standing+desks&hl=en&prmd=imvns&source=univ&tbm=shop&tbo=u&sa=X&ei=xohtUM-3GYi-9QStqYGoBQ&ved=0CLwBELMY&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&fp=c7e0ada04410524b&biw=1570&bih=1202)_.

At CoWork, we pride ourselves in being stuffy design punks, er, opinionated designers. Given that, we weren't about to go cubicle and get desks that should make a grown man cry. I'm pretty sure every time [this one](http://desks.dallasmidwest.com/Adjustable-Height-Hi-Lo-Carrel-45-57-J10059-Zoom.aspx) was built somewhere in China they kill a puppy. So like the pioneering design freaks we are, we set out to make our standing desks. We knew we wanted something industrial and cool that had adjustable height, which is an important part of using a standing desk.

I'd seen some of the great [projects](http://www.simplifiedbuilding.com/blog/sit-stand-work-desk-for-the-grain-mortar-studio/) on [Simplified Building](http://www.simplifiedbuilding.com/) and I knew that we could do something similar. I reached out to [Chris Pollock](http://sim.plified.com/) who runs SBC and he was so excited about our project that they decided to discount the [Kee Klamp](http://www.simplifiedbuilding.com/store/components.html) parts we needed for the desks. We designed our approach for the desks, bought the iron pipe and table tops (parts list below), and got to work! You'll see what an extremely safe and very serious group we are. We never drink beer on the job, and rarely join in any jocularity. Observe:
