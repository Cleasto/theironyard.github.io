We love how technology is helping people solve such a wide variety of problems. There really is an app for that, whether it's shortening your commute or streamlining your grocery list. Things get really exciting when the problem has a higher impact, like food allergies. 

BetaKit [recently featured a series of apps](http://betakit.com/2012/10/13/have-a-food-allergy-or-intolerance-theres-an-app-for-that) that "help people achieve some degree of normalcy when it comes to living with their food allergies, food intolerances and dietary choices," and Iron Yard alum [Spent](http://www.shopwithspent.com) was part of that mix.

Startup [Spent](http://www.shopwithspent.com) is also looking to connect people with food that suits their needs in a more general way. The platform is available on both iOS and Android and allows users to receive customized deals on groceries. **Users with food allergies or intolerances can create a personalized deal feed, and are then only shown and sent deals that are suitable to their allergies and/or correlate with their past purchases**.
