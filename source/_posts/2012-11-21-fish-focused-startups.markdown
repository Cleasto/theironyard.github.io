Today is [World Fisheries Day](http://www.gdrc.org/doyourbit/21_11-fisheries-day.html). Most people probably don't think about fisheries very often (overfishing is a [big problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfishing)). You probably don't think about fish related startups either. Shame on you. 

<p>So, in honor of this day of recognition, and neglected startups, and (mostly) because we're weird and like to have fun, we did a round of of fish focused startups.</p>
