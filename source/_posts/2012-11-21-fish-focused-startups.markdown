Today is [World Fisheries Day](http://www.gdrc.org/doyourbit/21_11-fisheries-day.html). Most people probably don't think about fisheries very often (overfishing is a [big problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfishing)). You probably don't think about fish related startups either. Shame on you. 

So, in honor of this day of recognition, and neglected startups, and (mostly) because we're weird and like to have fun, we did a round of of fish focused startups.
