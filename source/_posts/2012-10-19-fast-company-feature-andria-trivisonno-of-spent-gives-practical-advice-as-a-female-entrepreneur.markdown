Did you know that male entrepreneurs outnumbered women 3.5 to 1 between 1994 and 2010, and only 4% of founder applicants to YCombinator are women? Fast Company published those facts and others [in an article](http://www.fastcompany.com/3002241/practical-advice-female-entrepreneurs-who-stand-out-sea-dudes?partner=newsletter) that declares of the startup universe: "It's still a man's world."

The trend is beginning to change, though, and at The Iron Yard we're proud to be a part of it. One of our alumni teams, [Spent](http://www.shopwithspent.com), has a super-awesome female co-founder named Andria Trivisonno. 

Andria recently joined a handful of other female founders to share "a few ways women entrepreneurs say they've tackled the particular challenges they face in the startup world." Here thoughts are quoted below, but be sure to [read the full article here](http://www.fastcompany.com/3002241/practical-advice-female-entrepreneurs-who-stand-out-sea-dudes?partner=newsletter).

> ### Stand Out 

> Andria Trivisonno is learning how to leverage being in the minority. Now in her sophomore entrepreneurial venture with Spent, a platform for retailers to send targeted recommendations to shoppers, she was one of only two female cofounders participating in the recent Iron Yard accelerator program in Greenville, S.C.; her business partner Terry Horner is a guy.

> “I stand out a little more,” she says. “I like it.” That’s why Trivisonno was the one heading to Silicon Valley to drum up interest for Spent. She says, “If I email someone, it’s not coming from just another man.”

> She’s not afraid to buck the techies’ dress code of hoodies and jeans, either. “I want to show my personality and I like fashion,” she says of her choice to wear skirts and heels to meetings and presentations. “But I want to get noticed for what I say, not what I’m wearing,” she adds. That’s why Trivisonno says she’s learned to show her passion for her work. “Don’t let underlying fear drive you. Push past it. Everyone is trying to prove themselves.”
