For the last month we've been working on a project called The Iron Yard Academy, and we're excited to announce that [applications are open](http://www.theironyard.com/academy/apply) for our [Front End Engineering](http://www.theironyard.com/academy/the-iron-yard-academy) class. 

**What is this Iron Yard Academy, you ask?**

The Academy is a collection of intensive, in-person programming and design courses, built to take students from zero to hero in a short amount of time. When they complete the program, we'll help place them in a job. Other schools like this exist, but not in the Southeast.

**What subjects will you teach?**

We've opened applications for our three-month Front End Engineering class, and will launch a UX/UI course later this spring. We hope to add iOS and Rails courses later in the year. 

**What kind of instructors are teaching these classes?**

Our Front End instructor (and the head of our Academy program) is [Mason Stewart](http://twitter.com/masondesu). He's a seasoned engineer, and he's worked for small, Southern boutique web shops, startups from San Francisco to Greenville, and everywhere in between. He also heads up [CoderDojo Greenville](http://www.theironyard.com/academy/kids), teaching over 40 kids per week how to program in Scratch and JavaScript. (Check out a [video from the class](http://vimeo.com/58981618#at=0).)

Also, we can't say who just quite yet, but we recently hired a genius-level instructor for our upcoming UX/UI class. More news on that soon. 

**What will students be ready for after taking the courses?**

Here's what we'll prepare students for in the Front End class: 

You will be qualified as a professional, junior-level JavaScript and front-end engineer.




	
  * Join a startup and get a solid prototype off the ground quickly and efficiently

	
  * Build digital products for web development shop, agency, etc.

	
  * Build non-trivial, fast, efficient, production-quality apps

	
  * Build gorgeous websites

	
  * Most importantly, learn how to learn



You won't know absolutely everything there is to know, but we will ensure that you _know how to learn it_ if you need to.

**Ok, fancy pants, how much will this cost?**

$9,750, including housing and a MacBook air that you get to keep. For real. 

**CAN I APPLY RIGHT NOW??**

Absolutely. [Head over to our website](http://www.theironyard.com/academy/the-iron-yard-academy), read about the course, and [sign on up](http://www.theironyard.com/academy/apply). We've had lots of strong applicants already, so get it while it's hot.
