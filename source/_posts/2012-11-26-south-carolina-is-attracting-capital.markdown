South Carolina traditionally has struggled to garner as much venture capital as densely urban, high-tech areas, such as Austin, Boston, New York City or Silicon Valley. 

**But one Silicon Valley investor has taken notice of Greenville, and a few Palmetto State startups have attracted capital recently.**

South Carolina is attracting capital, and we're incredibly excited to be on the front lines. 

[Morganthaler Ventures](http://www.morgenthaler.com/) invested $14 million in Charleston-based [PeopleMatter](http://peoplematter.com/) earlier this year, and Kleiner Perkins has invested in two Greenville, SC companies, including [Proterra](http://www.proterra.com/index.php).

GSA Business, a local publication, [also says that](http://www.gsabusiness.com/news/45945-venture-capitalists-take-a-peek-at-s-c) in order to attract more capital, _"Companies and regions can up their chances of securing out-of-state venture capital. **Regions need to focus on creating technology hubs**, such as Charleston’s Digital Corridor or Greenville’s manufacturing hub of international companies."

> "The regions also need to **cultivate a skilled workforce, business community support and quality of life**," venture capital executives said._

The Iron Yard is doing just that, and we've got exciting news around the corner. Stay tuned.
