> New York, we love you, and we’re doing what we can to help. Team RidePost is hitting the road Monday, November 12th from South Carolina to New York. We’re hoping to pick up donations along the way for those that are still living with the aftermath of Sandy. If you’re interested in contributing to the cause, or would like to volunteer with us, shoot us an email at hello@ridepost.com and let’s get ‘er done! If you need a ride, hop in here: https://www.ridepost.com/#!/posts/374

There are a variety of ways we figure you can help, too:

If you’ve been affected by the outages of the mass-transit system, we ask you to post your rides. You can view the available rides below. Drivers and Riders - all are encouraged to post. The more trips posted, the more likely you are to connect with fellow travelers and get to where you need to be.
