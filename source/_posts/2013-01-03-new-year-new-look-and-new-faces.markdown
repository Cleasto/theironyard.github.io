We have some great New Year's surprises for you. 



#### 1) We re-branded.



Over the past few months we've worked with the uber-talented [Justin Hall](http://www.justinhalldesign.com/) to refine the look and feel of our brand. We're really excited about our new outfit, and we'll write in more detail about the process in the coming weeks.

#### 2) We launched a new website.



Along with the brand, we've just pushed a shiny [new site](http://theironyard.com) live. It's hot off the Rails, so let us know if you find any quirks. 



#### 3) We have some new faces in the office.

I realized that we forgot to officially announce my arrival on the blog, so we'll say this counts. 

More importantly, though, we've brought on Kate McCarthy as our Spartanburg program manager. She's awesome. 

_"WAIT, Spartanburg??"_ you say? Yes, Spartanburg. We're excited to announce that we'll run a second accelerator classes this year focused on healthcare IT. 



#### Happy New Year from The Iron Yard!
