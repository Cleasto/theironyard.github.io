We live and work in the South, and we love it. One of our favorite things is how surprised people get when they come visit - assumptions melt away and they find a thriving culture and growing tech scene.

Some of our friends up in Tennessee are wrapping as much of those ingredients in to one event as possible, and we're joining them. On June 12th and 13th, we're headed to Nashville for [Southland](http://www.southlandse.com/), a conference where we'll be connecting the Southeast's best early-stage companies with investors from across the country.

Come watch our region's hand-picked startups pitch, meet VCs and Angels from around the country, world class speakers, and of course, a full does of Southern music and food. 

If you're already going, [let us know](mailto:hello@theironyard.com?subject=I'm coming to Southland and would love to meet up). We'd love to meet you at the event.
