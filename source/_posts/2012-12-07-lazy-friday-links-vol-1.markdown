Who writes anything that requires critical thinking on Friday? You? Well hats off, good sir. I feel like I wrote a small novel this week, so I'm introducing a dazzling new feature called Lazy Friday Links.

Click well, my friends.

**1) Let's start with something serious and go downhill from there**.
[This Paul Graham post](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html) about startup ideas wrought some interesting conversation among a few of our teams. Marty from RidePost sent us [a great article](http://mattmaroon.com/2012/11/21/startup-ideas/) that questioned the Graham post, and Earl from Tribr sent us an awesome reminder called "[The Depressing Day After You Get TechCrunched.](http://viniciusvacanti.com/2012/11/19/the-depressing-day-after-you-get-techcrunched/)"

2) Awesome GIF Time, [avoiding work edition](http://i46.tinypic.com/zt7vpj.gif). 

3) All of the airplane landings at Sandiego International Airport on Nov. 23rd, [back-to-back-to-back.](http://vimeo.com/54658957)

4) [Awesomely bad advertising](/images/blog/2012/11/urn-your-biz.jpg). 

Oh, we almost forgot an [obligatory cat-related-something](http://kittencube.com/). (Hand crafted by our very own [David Haskins](https://twitter.com/skinnysc) at [CoWork](https://twitter.com/cowork).)

Happy Friday.
