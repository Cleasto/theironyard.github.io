We realized that our blog was essentially just a collection of pictures of obese animals. So we thought we'd take a week off from the corpulent creatures and do something healthy for a change. Like a cat eating kale.  

Ok, let's get going. 

**1) This week we're thinking about online privacy.** If you haven't seen Tom Scott's [collection of Facebook Graph searches](http://actualfacebookgraphsearches.tumblr.com/), you should. Here's a teaser:

Graph Search jokes are a good way of startling people into checking their privacy settings — but most people will never actually be affected by accidentally making data ‘public’. (Of course, for the unlucky ones, it won’t be a gamble worth taking.)

Most of the danger online comes not from strangers making half-assed joke searches: it comes from people who know you. A lot of the public data fails what I call the ‘bitter ex test’: can someone who hates you ruin your life with that information?

3) [Possibly the most amazing black and white photo ever](https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/287299_563556910323351_1872533864_o.jpg).

Happy Friday.
