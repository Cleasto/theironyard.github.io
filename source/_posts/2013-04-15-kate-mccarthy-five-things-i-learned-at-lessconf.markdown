This weekend I had the opportunity to attend LessConf. As a new comer to the tech/startup world and a first timer at what has to be (for lack of a better term) _the __coolest conference in the history_, I wanted to share a few take aways. Here are the top five things I learned at LessConf.

<!-- more -->

**1)   It’s better to be awesome than perfect.** Hosts [Allan](mailto:https://twitter.com/allanbranch) and [Steve](https://twitter.com/stevenbristol) and their international clan of programming weirdo cool kids really drove this home for me.  Steve’s response to weak wifi in the old movie theater where the first batch of talks went down: “I don’t care.  You shouldn’t be on the internet anyway.” These guys really embody the ethos of striving for awesomeness rather than perfection.

**2)   E-mail attachments might be your golden ticket.  **Just ask [Ryan O’Hara](https://twitter.com/Ryohara) from [Dyn](http://dyn.com/) who gave some sage advice on how to craft cold e-mails. EX: after a potential client he reached out to didn’t respond, he followed up with an email + photo attachment of him lying prostrate and depressed on the floor. Rule of thumb, even if you don’t get their business, make them fall in love with you.****

**3)   Baby kangaroos are my kryptonite. **At the opening dinner we were introduced to magical wildlife including a baby alligator and this absurdly adorable baby kangaroo. Just look at him!

**4)   Ask and ye shall receive.** The basics were well covered: from bug spray to sun screen (thanks [Engine Yard](https://www.engineyard.com)) there wasn't much wanting. The above and beyond came from conversations with the world class humans. Ex: Over breakfast, I lamented the difficulty we non-technical people have communicating desired website changes to our fabulous techie friends. Dun dah dah dun! Enter[ Joel Oliveira](https://twitter.com/jayroh) from ThoughtBot who blew my mind with a demo of [Skitch](http://evernote.com/skitch/). THANK YOU.****

**5)   Kill features that don't increase revenue.** On day two of talks, we took to the ocean for more pearls of wisdom. [Josh Pigford](https://twitter.com/Shpigford) of [Pop Survey](https://www.popsurvey.com) explained the urge to constantly ship new features, you know, a more is more philosophy. Instead, he encouraged the audience to kill any feature that doesn’t increase your revenue. Revenue neutral? Adios. I’d say this goes for life too. Often we add activities, classes, cleanses, and other “features” to our lives better. My challenge? Kill the features that don’t improve your bottom line of awesome.****

**And just because I can, I’m going to add a sixth and final learning.** Probably the biggest one of all. The tech/startup world is full of compassionate, alarmingly intelligent, bizarre, supportive, non-judgmental, goal oriented world class humans. I can’t imagine a better group to call my tribe.
