_At the end of 2012, we were lucky enough to get an email from a guy named Kevin Crace. He was finishing up at Boston Startup School after crushing through an architecture degree from [RISD](http://www.risd.edu/), all before he made it through age 25. If that wasn't enough, he's done great freelance work for startups like [Promoboxx](http://www.promoboxx.com/) and [Dashbell](http://dashbell.com/). Turns out he's passionate about the Southeast, and he wanted help out at The Iron Yard. We've already gotten his hands dirty with Iron Yard design projects, and we can't wait to see the incredible stuff he does for our startups. _

Meet Kevin: 

A quick hello from your friendly neighborhood designer-in-residence, 

So here I am in Greenville, SC by way of Boston and I gotta say that I am loving it, _y’all_. I just wrapped up with [Boston Startup School](http://bostonstartupschool.com/) where I was submerged in all things startup. I learned the lingo, the series, the culture fit, the hugs, and the sweat equity, but most importantly I learned about risk.

After rapidly building a network in Boston and meeting with many fresh startups, I realized how much community is valued. I decided to take a risk and leave Boston for a community I feel rooted to and a community I want to see thrive. I am thrilled to be a part of The Iron Yard because they have the same value and drive.  We’re here to see the Upstate thrive and to weave in rich pockets of tech and design.

I can’t wait to get my design hands dirty with the companies coming through the accelerator. I am eager to be a sponge for each mentor that walks in (call me SpongeBob Khaki Pants) and I am ready to immerse myself in the startup world of the Carolinas.

Here we go (high fives all around)!
