Happy New Year!

**1) Today's noodle-worker comes from a blog called "Mr. Money Mustache," so you know it's going to be awesome.**.
An article called "[Cure Yourself of Tiny Details Exaggeration Syndrome](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/12/26/cure-yourself-of-tiny-details-exaggeration-syndrome/)" was floated around the net a bit, and we thought it was self-reflective, kind of new years resolution-y, and all that other stuff that makes you feel optimistic about the future. Here's a quote to whet the palette: 

> Despite their advantaged position, people seem to become unaware of the wide variety of conditions in the world and their own ability as a human to deal with them. The results are both tragic and amusing.

4) The Iron Yard launched a [snazzy new website](http://theironyard.com). _(See what we did there?)_

Happy Friday.
