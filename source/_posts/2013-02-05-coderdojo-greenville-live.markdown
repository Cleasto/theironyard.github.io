We've talked a lot about our [CoderDojo program](http://www.theironyard.com/academy/kids) for kids, and we've even shared [great stories](http://blog.theironyard.com/2013/01/getting-to-their-level-teaching-kids-to-code/) we've experienced along the way. 

We recently had [Chris Brank](http://chrisbrankfilms.com/) and his team fire up the video cameras so you could see what it looks like live.
