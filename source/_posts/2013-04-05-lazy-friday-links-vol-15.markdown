Yeah, yeah, we didn't publish anything last week. We were launching a code school, for crying out loud.

**1) Along with launching a code school, we announced a product design class taught by Marco Suarez. ** [He wrote an amazing post called "The Gap" about why we started a design school](https://medium.com/tech-talk/fce9d38d2290). Here's a taste:

Happy Friday.
