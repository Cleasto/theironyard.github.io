A few weeks ago we packed up our accelerator and headed north for the [GAN Founders Conference](http://gan.co/blog/events/ganfounder-2012-in-review) in Boston. 

Along with some bangin' vietnamese food, local beer, and watching [Rich Winley](https://twitter.com/Rich_Winley) freeze, we met amazing entrepreneurs and learned from really smart people. 

Here are a few takeaways from our teams:

#### Steve Palmer from _[Trucky Love](https://www.truckylove.com/)_

For the TruckyLove team, we enjoyed being in a room full of startup founders who all have experienced or are experiencing many of the same challenges. It was great to have access to so many people, from founders to investors, and learn from the great speakers.

#### Mark Liu from _[Leaguevine](https://www.leaguevine.com/)_

The GAN Conference was a great way to meet amazing CEOs from other parts of the world. There was a ton of time for socializing at bars and I ended up making some new friendships that will last well beyond the conference.

#### Marty Bauer from _[RidePost](https://www.ridepost.com/)_

Being at GAN allowed us to not only connect with other companies and founders but also expand the reach of our own product. Introducing it to new faces cannot be understated. 

The three days in Boston were a good way for our company to step back and appreciate the process of being part of The Iron Yard. The mentors are invaluable and the additional perks are helpful. But the true value of The Iron Yard and other GAN accelerators is the unique opportunity to spend 3 months heads down with a singular focus on product development. The startup capital and co-work space creates a cocoon to focus only on building something great. In the end though it is still on us as founders to make the most of the time and opportunity. 

Being at GAN in Boston gave us perspective of where The Iron Yard stacks up today to other accelerators and where we are heading in the future.

_Dang Marty. We're blushing._

#### John Krebsbach from _[Spent](https://www.shopwithspent.com/)_

I thought the GAN conference was great. I enjoyed the opportunity to meet fellow founders. As peers, we have much to share and learn from one another from pitching and funding to product development and marketing. The atmosphere they struck at the conference encouraged candid and helpful conversations. 

GAN also did a great job in structuring the conference to encourage networking. Having people rotate tables each topic discouraged people from falling into the age old trap of sitting with people they already know. The discussion time after speakers also got people talking and enabled me to form natural connections with other attendees. I'm looking forward to attending more GAN events in the future.

#### And here are a few thoughts from yours truly:

**1) People in the startup space are awesome human beings**
I'm fairly new to startup world, and this conference was my first fully immersive experience. Almost every single person I met was really smart, really interesting, and really open. Lots of them were also hilarious, as we found out at Ignite. (An extremely witty Frenchman [used these maps](http://alphadesigner.com/mapping-stereotypes/) in his talk on doing business abroad.) I'll take all of that I can get. 

**2) There was great practical advice on getting visibility for your company**
Both [Elaine Ellis](http://twitter.com/elaineellis) and [Chris Roche](https://twitter.com/ChrisRocheDC) gave great reminders that the fundamentals of a good communications plan are pretty simple. 

Elaine on social media: _"Your time is more valuable than the number of social media channels you're on. Be picky, and let Google Analytics be your guide in showing you where to invest your time. And most importantly, don't push content out on social media just to push it out. If you're not proud of it, don't publish it."_

Chris gave us a really great pathway to follow for PR: 

  1. What's my story?
  2. Where do I want to tell it?
  3. Who do I want to tell it to?
  4. Find those writers and publications, and start by building relationships with them.

Both emphasized the fact that developing ongoing relationships with journalists was essential to coverage - you'll rarely ever be successful if your first contact with a writer is a pitch. 

**3) Seth Godin is really, really smart**
And he's really nice. I mean, he seemed really nice from the stage - he was one of the most thankful, considerate speakers I've seen. Here are the two things that stuck out as I reviewed my notes from his talk: 

First was the idea of gifts VS attitudes VS skills. Almost every single quality you want in someone that you are going to hire is either an attitude or a skill. Further, attitudes can be taught, meaning they are a skill in some sense. The lesson? Get out of the mindset that you can hire some sort of specially gifted guru - people who are humble, willing to learn, and willing to work hard make the best hires and biggest impact on your company. 

Second was the concept of building impetus to share into your product from the beginning. Seth said something along the lines of, "Build in a reason for people to share what you make. Build the story into your app - make it work better if your friends use it. If you don't do that, you drastically decrease the chances of your product being found." 

**4) I want to be Saul Colt (kind of)**
I'll guarantee one thing: no one who attended his talk forgot Mr. Saul Colt. The guy is crazy, and brilliant. And he wanted everyone to know how good of a lover he was. And he sent mustard to a rival marketer. (Yes, it was that weird.)

Joking aside, I used to work in marketing, and far and away it's the best speech on the subject I've ever seen. He presented a flash flood of wacky, ingenius and cost effective ideas he's implemented for companies over the years - and the results of how well they worked. Here are some one liners that stuck out to me: 

  * Taking it one step too far is what people remember
  * But, you have to know where the line is with your customers - you have to cross it just enough, and not too much
  * If you can't compete, change the rules
  * Know, like, trust (if you know someone, like them, and then trust them, you will talk about them)
  * Promoting product features rarely works. Companies need stories, loyalty, and focus on people being excited about being part of a community, not a transactional relationship
  * The more connected you are with your customers, the better you will know what they want. But even more import than that is the more you know your customers, the more you will try not to disappoint them

#### Bonus: One really good and one really awkward picture of The Iron Yard Team

GAN took an awesome shot of Peter (our Managing Director). Look at that grin.

They also took a picture of me making some sort of weird chicken-wing-flapping motion. Flattering.
