Grok is a unique conference. While we did add keynote speakers last year (at the request of attendees), the emphasis has always been on honest, problem-tackling conversations in small groups where no one is a hero. Problems are solved, companies are launched, and creative people are refreshed and encouraged. It's awesome. 

Last year we added another component that people loved: a healthy dose of fun. Our brains work best with periods of non-work downtime and activities. This is especially true of creative people.[^1]

Last year we played kickball on the field in the Fenway-replica stadium our ball team in Greenville uses (they're the Single A feeder for the Red Sox). It was a blast. 

This year, we're upping the game again. 

**For half-a-day, attendees will driving brand new BMW race cars on a private race track and SUV's on a private off-road course.**

*We're not kidding*. (And yes, [tickets are still available](https://tito.io/the-iron-yard/Grok-2014).)

Here are a few videos to get you excited:
