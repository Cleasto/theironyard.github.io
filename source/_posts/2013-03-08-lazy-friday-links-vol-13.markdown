This post is coming to you from the wonderful city of San Francisco, fueled by the famous [Blue Bottle coffee](http://www.bluebottlecoffee.com/locations/mint-cafe/). 

<!-- more -->

**1) There's been a ton of talk about startup communities with the release of Brad Feld's new book.** So for today's Link With Actual Value™, we wanted to point you to a fascinating article called [Seeding a Silicon Valley: How Poland is creating a startup ecosystem from scratch](http://qz.com/3396/seeding-a-silicon-valley-how-poland-is-creating-a-startup-ecosystem-from-scratch/). 

The author analyzes the good and bad of the _"Billions of the EU dollars that pour into Poland each year...intended to promote entrepreneurship and innovation. As Warsaw rushes to dole out the cash, a startup boom has been born–but can state subsidies really act as seed capital, and what will happen when the EU turns off the spigots?"_

2) [j.viewz playing Teardrop with vegetables](https://vimeo.com/60554403). Musicians. They are crazy. 

3) [Keanu Reeves and Nicholas Cage as Toy Story heroes](http://i.imgur.com/NCx8rES.png).

Happy Friday y'all.
