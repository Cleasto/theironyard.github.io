Yesterday we broke a 55 day streak of silence on the blog. That means Lazy Friday Links are back, baby. 

Not sure what Lazy Friday Links are? 

<!-- more -->

We started this end-of-the-week tradition to celebrate productivity by engaging in meaningless disctraction. Well, mostly. We include a single thought-provoking link (so we don't feel like complete slackers), and a healthy drink from distraction-filled ocean of internet weirdness. We used to put the heady stuff first, but we'll save that for last so you don't have to bother if you don't want to. 

*Also, as a sidenote, in yesterday's post, we mentioned that we're not going to sprinkle hyperlinks throughout our posts, forgoing the most common reference method for footnotes, like this.[^1] Because Lazy Friday Links is all about distraction, we'll ignore that rule. But only on Fridays.* 

That's almost too much thinking already, so let's move onward to diversion. 

**Number one**  
Fifty-five minutes and fifteen seconds of [pure 80s televison gold](https://vimeo.com/55006097).

**Number two**  
An amazing reel of NFL Kickoff footage [quoting a famous scene from *The Princess Bride*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1USHmMw2dI8#t=45).

**Number three**  
Bill Nye the [science](http://i.imgur.com/DrXpLu5.gif) guy.

**Number four**  
A frighteningly well executed stopping of a car and arresting of its driver, [through the winshield](http://i.imgur.com/i2Z85jB.jpg).

**Number five (warning: requires thought)**  
You might have noticed that technology has upended industry after industry in the last few years, and it's picking up speed. If you haven't noticed that, well, it's Friday. We can all be happy.

Adam Davidson [wrote a fascinating piece](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/01/making-it-in-america/308844/) exploring technology in manufacturing and how it affects jobs of workers in that industry. Here's a taste: 

> The double shock we’re experiencing now—globalization and computer-aided industrial productivity—happens to have the opposite impact: income inequality is growing, as the rewards for being skilled grow and the opportunities for unskilled Americans diminish.

> I went to South Carolina, and spent so much time with Maddie, precisely because these issues are so large and so overwhelming. I wanted to see how this shift affected regular people’s lives.

Happy Friday. It's good to be back.

[^1]: Text riddled with hyperlinks isn't good for your brain. Here's a quote from a [WIRED piece](http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/05/ff_nicholas_carr/) that details the science behind the issue: "*Research continues to show that people who read linear text comprehend more, remember more, and learn more than those who read text peppered with links.*" Again, we're ignoring this for Lazy Friday Links.
