CoderDojo is a movement orientated around running free not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people.

Mason Stewart and a handful of rockin' volunteers are launching [CoderDojo: Greenville](http://coderdojogreenville.com) - a place where young people will learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and more. On top of the courses, they'll tour tech companies, bring in guest speakers, and host fun events for participants. The Iron Yard is excited to be hosting these courses for talented youngsters at our Greenville location (in the NEXT Center). 

The first round of classes will be held **every Tuesday 6pm to 7:30pm, October 2 - November 6**, 2012. Mason is going to be teaching the first 6 weeks in a language called [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) (developed by MIT). If you haven't ever used it, it's actually super fun for adults.

Make sure to [visit the signup page](http://coderdojogreenville.com/signup) if you’re interested in attending. Spots are available for kids 8 to 18 years old, and because of limited seating they can’t take walk-ins - _make sure to get a ticket first_!

If you can't tell already, Mason and his crew have a big heart for helping kids work towards great careers, great relationships with their peers, and real involvement with their communities. 

If you have that same big heart, you can get involved too. Visit the [CoderDojo FAQ](http://coderdojogreenville.com/volunteer) or [email Mason Stewart](mailto:mason@coderdojogreenville.com?Subject=I'm%20interested%20in%20CoderDojo%20Greenville!) for more info.
