One of our teams ([Pathwright](http://www.pathwright.com/)) just launched an amazing [Kickstarter campagin](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pathwrightpress/the-lamp-post-guild) called "The Lamp Post Guild."

This project forges a unique marriage between online technology and the age-old offline craft of drawing. It will lead participants through three courses that teach "_professional illustration to aspiring artists and help them make a living doing what they love._"

Read the full story below, and don't forget to [back the project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pathwrightpress/the-lamp-post-guild).

_Congrats to the Pathwright crew: Mark, Paul, Greg, and Justin. Great work guys!_

Every kid drew pictures until someone told them they couldn’t. Millions of people wanted to become artists when they grew up, but they were told that being an artist is not a "real job." Only a few of them will actually make it as professional artists. It doesn't have to end this way.

We want to make this story end differently for these aspiring illustrators and artists by teaching online courses that will help them improve their craft and earn a living doing what they love.

We need your help to launch the first three courses that will form the beginning of an online art school called The Lamp Post Guild.** In each of these courses, we'll teach high-level concepts and step-by-step processes that will help you think and work like a professional illustrator.** As professional illustrators ourselves, we’ve learned these things the hard way and want to pass that knowledge on to you at a price you won’t have to go into debt for.

Each online course will include:



	
  * A clear path of step-by-step lessons to complete at your own pace

	
  * High-quality video demonstrations of techniques and concepts

	
  * Digital resources and art assets to help with your projects (Photoshop brushes, textures, reference artwork, etc.)

	
  * Opportunities to share your work and receive critique from your class

	
  * Carefully chosen readings related to the course topic

	
  * Opportunities to discuss technique and concepts with your class

	
  * A signed certificate of completion once you've finished the course

	
  * Lifetime access to the course content

	
  * Our goals are to make these courses affordable (wer'e thinking $99-$150) and available to anyone in the world.


Note: _By supporting this project on Kickstarter, you can get early, priority access to the courses for yourself or you may gift the courses to a friend or family member!_
