Welcome to Lazy Friday Links, Vol. 17, "a list of distracting links you can actually feel good about."

<!-- more --> 

*For the record, in-text links aren't our normal speed.[^1]*

**Number one**  
Scaling walls by [back-bouncing insanely high off of a trampoline](https://gimmebar-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/524443273aa05.gif).

**Number two**  
[A shark in a cat costume on a Roomba.](https://gimmebar-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/523dd1c349552.gif)

**Number three**  
The most insane [long-snapping,football-hiking tricks you've ever seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE6m9h5yipE).

**Number four**  
["BatDad is keeping Atlanta safe from bad manners and artificial sweeteners."](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlVi0noRr-o)

**Number five (warning: requires thought)**  
Earlier this week we mentioned Matthew Butterick in a footnote. You should read his speech called ["The Bomb in the Garden."](http://unitscale.com/mb/bomb-in-the-garden/)

Here's a taste: 

> We need to work for the web that we want. To rein­vent. To de­mand bet­ter. It’s not that we’re go­ing to get every­thing. But if we work at it, we’ll get some­thing. And if we don’t work at it, we’ll definitely get nothing. But ei­ther way, we’ll be get­ting the web that we deserve.

Happy Friday.

—Eric
