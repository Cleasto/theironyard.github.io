Area Development just [ranked South Carolina #2 overall](http://www.areadevelopment.com/Top-States-for-Doing-Business/Fall2012/Strong-Business-Labor-Climat-South-Carolina-789932.shtml) in the best places to do business...in the country. An excerpt from the article is below, but first, a celebration is in order. SC, we're proud of you and proud to be a part of what's going on. Cheers. 

_From the ranking report:_

> South Carolina is on a roll — the Palmetto State brought in a total investment of $3.37 billion from new and expanding businesses in 2011. Manufacturing is also on the mend, with total exports up by 21 percent last year. These are just some of the reasons South Carolina was ranked second by the consultants among the Top States for Doing Business, up from fourth place in 2011.

The consultants also ranked South Carolina second for its overall business environment and overall labor climate (tied) because of its competitive labor costs and leading work force development programs. This is a result of the state’s pro-active approach to building a ready and willing work force that provides the advanced skill sets companies need for their new operations. ReadySC, South Carolina’s work force development program, has trained more than 250,000 workers for nearly 2,000 companies.
