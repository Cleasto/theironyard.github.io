Merry Christmas, everyone. Let's get lazy: 

**1) Our Link That Actually Makes You Thinkâ„¢ is about how phones are getting, well, really really smart**.
Pando Daily ran a piece about 'app overload' that discussed machine learning and how "your smartphone already knows you better than your mom does." We're really intrigued by recent talk on services like [Google Now](http://www.google.com/landing/now/) and [Grokr](http://www.grokrlabs.com/product), and yes, artificial intelligence. (And we want to see [Ray's new office at Google](http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/14/ray-kurzweil-joins-google-as-engineering-director-focusing-on-machine-learning-and-language-tech/).)

2) People in Wisconsin, in the fall, [wakeboarding on cranberries](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=dEe9Q2KQvM4#!).

3) Speaking of Wisconsin, they [put cheese on roads](http://wtvr.com/2012/12/13/how-cheese-helps-snowy-roads-from-becoming-too-slick/) to keep them clear in the winter.

4) And of course, Christmas wouldn't be Christmas [without](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_llqo6a20Z21qfjbhyo1_500.gif) [Macaulay](http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs1/1142775_o.gif) [Culkin](http://www.gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs2/1108864_o.gif).

_[*Obligatory holiday cat-related-something](https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6866623232/h9258631C/)._

Happy Friday, and happy holidays.
