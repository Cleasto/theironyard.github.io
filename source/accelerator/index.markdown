#### We’re interested in building strong, sustainable businesses that add real value to customer’s lives.

Speaking the same language? We’d love for you to join us.Whether your goal is a Series A round, building a team and bootstrapping, or utilizing Kickstarter, we have a place for you.

We run two programs a year, an [open tech program](/accelerator/tech-program) in the spring, and a [digital health program](/accelerator/digital-health-program) in the late summer/fall.

#### What makes us different, you ask?

*It’s a secret sauce with two ingredients:*

**The first is our network of mentors.** CEOs and investors are must-haves, but they’re not the only ingredients to success. We partner with specialists in marketing, design, community management, and other disciplines to offer truly well-rounded support.

**The second is The Iron Yard community.** Along with supportive alumni (in the same town), our program is located in a space that provides coworking for all sorts of professionals, intensive code education, and hosts nationally-known technology and design events.
