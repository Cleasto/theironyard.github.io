### What makes us different, you ask?

_It’s a secret sauce with two ingredients:_

**The first is our network of mentors.** CEOs and investors are must-haves, but they’re not the only ingredients to success. We partner with specialists in marketing, design, community management, and other disciplines to offer truly well-rounded support.

**The second is The Iron Yard community.** Along with supportive alumni (in the same town), our program is located in a space that provides coworking for all sorts of professionals, intensive code education, and hosts nationally-known technology and design events.

Did we mention that the best coffee shop on the east coast is moving into our [Greenville space](/accelerator/spring-program/), and our [Spartanburg Program](/accelerator/fall-program/) is one block from a brewery?
