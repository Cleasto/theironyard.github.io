At the Academy we can take you from from zero to hero in 3 months. Practicing
professionals teach you everything there is to know about code or design and then help you find a job with your new skills.

### CoderDojo - _Programming and Electronics_

At the Dojo we teach young people learn how to code, developing websites, apps, programs, games and _even robots_. On top of the courses, theyâ€™ll tour tech companies, listen to guest speakers, and host fun events.
