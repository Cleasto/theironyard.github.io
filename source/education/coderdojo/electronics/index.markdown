### CoderDojo: Electronics

In our electronics classes, students learn the basics of hardware programming. Using the amazing Arduino, they will tackle everything from blinking LED lights to creating a basic video game controller. (Yes, this is only for kids.)

The really cool part: those who have completed the [Scratch](/education/coderdojo/scratch) course will build controllers for their videogames. (We repeat, this is only for kids.)

Here's an overview of the curriculum: 

* Intro to Arduino
* Working with the Arduino IDE
* Programming for the Arduino Esplora board's components: LED, accelerometer, joystick, light sensor, buzzer, microphone and temperature sensor
* Intro to Processing
* Interacting with Processing sketches using the Esplora board

#### Do you need to have prior experience with electronics? 

Nope! As long as you can type, push buttons and connect cables, you are good to go.

### 2013 Greenville Schedule

Electronics classes will be 6 weeks long with a 2-3 week break between each session. We don't hold class on holiday on weeks that include holidays. Our goal is to run them throughout the school year. Volunteers make this possible, [so please sign up today](http://eepurl.com/DWo8v)! 

The following sessions are open for registration:

<a href="https://tito.io/the-iron-yard/greenville-coderdojo-electronics-october-2013" class="button"> Oct. 16th - Dec. 4th</a>  

*These classes are 100% free and run on the generous donation of volunteers time. Spots are filled on a first-come-first-serve basis.*

## FAQ

#### Will the class break for holidays?

Yes, we won't hold class on October 30th or November 27th. 

#### Do we get to keep the electronics equipment? 

We re-use our equipment in future classes, but if you'd like to purchase the equipment at the end of the class you are more than welcome to. 

#### Do I need to be in class with my child?

If your child is younger than 13 years old, we require you to be in the class with them. Watch out, because you might just have more fun than they do. 

#### I registered interest in a full class. How will I know if my child gets in?

If a student in a full class drops out before the course starts, we will give their spot to those who registered interest on a first-come-first serve basis. 

#### Do I need to sign any legal paperwork in order for my child to take the class? 

We require every student to have a waiver/release form signed by a parent or guardian. You will recieve a link to this form when you sign up for a ticket.

#### Roy Schmidt

**Electronics Instructor**

I moved to Greenville in 2012 from Seattle, where I worked at Disney, Microsoft and a startup called BigDoor. I recently got interested in Arduino as a hobby and I'm looking forward to learning more along with you!

These classes wouldn't be possible without support from [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/). Kids in our classes will be introduced to electronics using the Arduino [Esplora](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardEsplora), and will ultimately create their own game controller! The Arduino team is responsible for making lots of kids repeatedly smile, and we're excited to introduce more kids (and adults) to the fun.
