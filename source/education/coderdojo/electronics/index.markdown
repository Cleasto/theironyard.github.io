### CoderDojo: Electronics

In our Electronics classes, students learn the basics of programming hardware. Using the amazing Arduino, kids will tackle everything from sequencing blinking lights to elementary robotics. (Yes, this is only for kids.)

The really cool part: those who have completed the [Scratch](/education/coderdojo/scratch) course will build controllers for their videogames. (We repeat, this is only for kids.)

#### Our Wonderful Sponsor: Arduino

These classes wouldn't be possible without support from [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/). Kids in our classes will be introduced to electronics using the Arduino [Esplora](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardEsplora), and will ultimately create their own game controller! The Arduino team is responsible for making lots of kids repeatedly smile, and we're excited to introduce more kids (and adults) to the fun.

**These classes are 100% free and run on the generous donation of volunteers time.** Spots are filled on a first-come-first-serve basis.

## FAQ

#### Do I need to be in class with my child?

If your child is younger than 13 years old, we require you to be in the class with them. Watch out, because you might just have more fun than they do. 

#### I registered interest in a full class. How will I know if my child gets in?

If a student in a full class drops out before the course starts, we will give their spot to those who registered interest on a first-come-first serve basis. 

#### Do I need to sign any legal paperwork in order for my child to take the class? 

We require every student to have a waiver/release form signed by a parent or guardian. You will recieve a link to this form when you sign up for a ticket.
