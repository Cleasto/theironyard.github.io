    <p class="bio">I recently graduated from the Iron Yard's grueling, three-month front-end engineering program. I've learned a ton about programming and it's been an awesome experience. For all the local foodies out there, I created an app call <a href="http://alisonelizabeth.github.io/goLocal/">goLocal</a> for my final project at the Iron Yard. It allows users to share places where they've found local food, such as farms and produce stands. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me catching up on the latest news (I have a background in journalism), playing with my golden retriever, Hanna, riding horses or socializing with friends. </p>

    <h1 class="name">Brandon Miller</h1>
    <p class="bio">I am a Front End Developer, Contemporary Northern Traditional Powwow Dancer, and former Boy Scout Resident Camp Program Director living in the Upstate of South Carolina. I was inspired to become a developer by working with people who were oppressed under the weight of archaic pen-and-paper systems or crazy schedules that software could vastly improve. I'm most proud of my project <a href="http://brandonemiller.github.io/DriveTime/">DriveTime</a>, an app that schedules your calendar to include traveling time to meetings. I see myself as a problem solver and see each build as a new problem to solve. Being able to build something that meets a need is what drives me to be a developer.</p>

    <h1 class="name">Joe VanLeeuwen</h1>
    <p class="bio">I recently graduated from a 3 month Front End Engineering course at The Iron Yard. The work in my portfolio represents long hours plugging away at assignments for the class. I titled my final project <a href="http://joe-vanleeuwen.github.io/chess.js">chess.js</a> and I am most satisfied with this endeavor. Besides hacking away at something that is way over my head, I also enjoy running, especially trail running. My last big race was the Bel Monte 50 Miler back in April of '13. I hope to run a 100 miler some day!</p>

    <p class="bio"> After five years working at Apple Stores, my brother and I created a small startup called Surprise Co. At the same time, I created my own company called App Shirt Co. I am still working on both. In August 2013, I moved to Greenville, SC to take a 12-week intensive front-end engineering class. There, I learned the skills necessary to become a true developer. I am currently looking for a web developement position with a progressive, growth-oriented company that offers challenging opportunities and responsibilities with the potential for career advancement. I am willing to relocate for the perfect position.</p>

    <p class="bio"> Having recently completed the Iron Yard Academy's front end engineering course, I can proudly call myself a web developer. I've always been hungry for knowledge and the ever-expanding world of web development is a great place to be for someone like myself. Since taking the course, I've found myself thinking with more discipline and intuition than I could have previously imagined. My final project was <a href="flackap.com/instagrab">Instagrab</a>, a webapp that allows users to search for user-specific tags (a feature that Instagram currently lacks). When I'm not hacking away at my latest project, I like to make music with my friends or relax at the park with a good book and my dog.</p>

I learned to look at all areas of the problem and analyze them before making a decision. This new way of thinking has taught me to look at all problems differently, whether they involve programming or everyday life. As I move forward, I'm excited to continue to grow, learn and continue to improve upon my thinking and problem solving abilities.</p>
