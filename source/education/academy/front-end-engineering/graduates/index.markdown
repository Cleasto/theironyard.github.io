      <p class="bio">I recently graduated from the Iron Yard's grueling, three-month front-end engineering program. I've learned a ton about programming and it's been an awesome experience. For all the local foodies out there, I created an app call <a href="http://alisonelizabeth.github.io/goLocal/">goLocal</a> for my final project at the Iron Yard. It allows users to share places where they've found local food, such as farms and produce stands. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me catching up on the latest news (I have a background in journalism), playing with my golden retriever, Hanna, riding horses or socializing with friends. </p>

      <h1 class="name">Brandon Miller</h1>
      <p class="bio">I am a Front End Developer, Contemporary Northern Traditional Powwow Dancer, and former Boy Scout Resident Camp Program Director living in the Upstate of South Carolina. I was inspired to become a developer by working with people who were oppressed under the weight of archaic pen-and-paper systems or crazy schedules that software could vastly improve. I'm most proud of my project <a href="http://brandonemiller.github.io/DriveTime/">DriveTime</a>, an app that schedules your calendar to include traveling time to meetings. I see myself as a problem solver and see each build as a new problem to solve. Being able to build something that meets a need is what drives me to be a developer.</p>

      <h1 class="name">Joe VanLeeuwen</h1>
      <p class="bio">I recently graduated from a 3 month Front End Engineering course at The Iron Yard. The work in my portfolio represents long hours plugging away at assignments for the class. I titled my final project <a href="http://joe-vanleeuwen.github.io/chess.js">chess.js</a> and I am most satisfied with this endeavor. Besides hacking away at something that is way over my head, I also enjoy running, especially trail running. My last big race was the Bel Monte 50 Miler back in April of '13. I hope to run a 100 miler some day!</p>
