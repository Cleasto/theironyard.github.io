            p Before we get into specifics, we need to let you know that this class is going to be challenging. Material will get really hard, really quickly. All of the work is very do-able, but if you think you're going to develop professional level skills in a cushy 40 hour week, this isn't the place for you. (We estimate you'll put in about 60.) We're family people, so our goal is for you to work as hard as possible in class so you can find balance in a great job when you're done.
            p We're really excited about the different types of people who are going to apply, and we don't have stereotypes of what a designer is like. Here are a few things we'll look for

      h3 Man, that's awesome. But what makes you different from the other schools? 
      p We've answered that question <a href="/what-makes-our-school-different">in more detail here</a>, but here are a few highlghts:
      ul

        li Dollar for dollar, we're the most accessible program out there. Laptop, housing, a bike, and a job. It doesn't get much more full service than that. 
        li Our instructors are industry-respected professionals who gave up crazy good job offers because they're passionate about teaching you. 
        li We work on real projects for real people. You'll make living breathing stuff. 
        li You'll work shoulder to shoulder with our Accelerator teams when they're in session, and when they're not you'll work side by side with the amazingly talented people in our coworking space. Not to mention the fact that you'll have access to our mentors and Accelerator perks.
    .question style="margin-right:0;"
      h3 Job Placement
      p If you choose to enroll in the job placement program, we'll do our darndest to put you where you want to be, and we're putting our money where our mouth is. 
      p We cannot guarantee the exact salary or location of the job, but if you don't get an offer in 6 months, we'll give you your tuition back. <a href="mailto:academy@theironyard.com?subject=I have a question about the job placement program"> Contact us for more details.</a>
    .question
      h3 So what's up with Greenville?
      p Greenville is an amazing place to live. Rivers, parks, amazing food and music are all walking or riding distance from the classroom. The mountains are a 45 minute car ride, and the weather is good almost all year. <a href="/greenville">Head over here and see for yourself</a>. 
    .question
      h3 I can't make the next class, is there a schedule of upcoming courses? 
      p Absolutely. Here's our schedule:
      ul
        li August - October 2013
        li January - March 2014
        li April - June 2014
    .question
      h3 <a name="details"></a> How much does it cost?
      p We strive to make our courses as affordable accessible as possible, providing students with a brand new laptop, housing, and a bike to ride to class. You can  fly in, catch a ride from the airport to our apartments, and take our classes without having to worry about where to stay or how to get around. 
      p <b>Tuition</b> 
      ul
       li Tuition is <b>$7500</b>, and we have significan discounts for enlisted military personel and veterans. Do we offer payent options? <a href="#financing">You better believe it</a>. 
      p <b>Housing</b>
      ul
        li Housing is available for <b>$1500</b>. We have a block of really nice, fully-furnished apartments that are reserved for our academy students year round. We've done our research and it's almost impossible to find cheaper (nice) living if you don't live in town. 
      p <b>Laptop</b>
      ul
        li Brand new MacBook Airs are available for <b>$1000</b>. We get a sweet deal on computers, but if you want to use your own machine it has to be a recent Apple laptop, with ample processing speed and hard drive space. Not sure if yours qualfies?  <a href="mailto:academy@theironyard.com?subject=Will my computer work for the Product Design class?"> Give us a shout.</a>
    .question 
      h3 <a name="financing"></a> What are the payment options? 
      ul 
        li If you pay the full cost of tuition up front, you'll get a <b>$250 discount</b>. We also offer <b>financing</b>: pay 1/3 of the tuition up front, and the balance in even payments over 6 months.
        li The cost of <b>housing</b> is spread evenly over the duration of the course.
        li The cost of the <b>laptop</b> will be due on the first day of the course.
