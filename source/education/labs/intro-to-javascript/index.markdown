## FAQ

#### Is there an age limit?

On the young end, students have to be at least 8 years old to take the class. There's no maximum age, but you do have to know how to type. 

#### I registered interest in a full class. How will I know if I get in? 

If a student in a full class drops out before the course starts, we will give their spot to those who registered interest on a first-come-first serve basis. 

#### Is there any paperwork necessary for kids taking the class? 

We require every student under 18 to have a waiver/release form signed by a parent or guardian. You will recieve a link to this form when you sign up for a ticket.
