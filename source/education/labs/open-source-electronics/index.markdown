### Open Source Electronics

In this class you'll learn about electronics and how to control/program electronic components. You'll discover all of the components *that make up a robot* and how they work.

The goal at the end of the class is for you to have learned enough to **a)** continue to learn about electricity, electronics, and programming through online resources, and **b)** be able to build circuits of your own imagination. (We won't be making "robots," so if that's what you want to do, join a FIRST Lego League.)

## FAQ

#### My child is younger than 13. Is there any way he/she can take the class?

This class is a bit more advanced, so we don't accept students younger than 13, and we strongly recommend that 13-14 year olds have some experience with electronics (or a parent with experience).

#### Do you break for holidays? 

Yes, we will take a one week break so that families can enjoy Halloween. 

#### I registered interest in a full class. How will I know if my child gets in?

If a student in a full class drops out before the course starts, we will give their spot to those who registered interest on a first-come-first serve basis. 

#### Do I need to sign any legal paperwork in order for my child to take the class? 

We require every student to have a waiver/release form signed by a parent or guardian. You will recieve a link to this form when you sign up for a ticket.
