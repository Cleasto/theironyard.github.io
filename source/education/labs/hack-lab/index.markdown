### Hack Lab

Many of our CoderDojo and Labs students have completed our classes but still want a place where they can continue to pursue their passion for technology and programming. We've built the Hack Lab, an after school program designed to continue self-paced exploration of technology for kids. A qualified tech professional will serve as an overseer and guide for the students, helping each individual member move their projects forward.

## FAQ

#### My child is younger than 13. Is there any way he/she can take the class?

If your child has completed CoderDojo Scratch, CoderDojo Electronics, or both, they may take this course. We don't accept students younger than 8 years old.

#### Do you break for holidays?

Absolutely. We won't have class on Thanksgiving Day (11/28) in the fall or the week of 4/17 (Spring Break).

#### I registered interest in a full class. How will I know if my child gets in?

If a student in a full class drops out before the course starts, we will give their spot to those who registered interest on a first-come-first serve basis. 

#### Do I need to sign any legal paperwork in order for my child to take the class? 

We require every student to have a waiver/release form signed by a parent or guardian. You will recieve a link to this form when you sign up for a ticket.
