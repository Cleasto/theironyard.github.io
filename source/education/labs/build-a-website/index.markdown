### ![Students discussing the Scratch programming language at CoderDojo](https://theironyard.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/image_asset/storage/25/scratch-1-edit.jpg)

### Video Games Built from Scratch

In the video game module, students learn a&nbsp;visual programming language called&nbsp;[Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) (developed by MIT). Kids learn programming fundamentals and video game basics, building their very own video game in the first few nights of class.

### Website Basics: HTML and CSS

In the website module, students learn the internet fundamentals, how the browser works, and the basics of&nbsp;how to build something for the web. While gaining a working knowledge of both markup and CSS, kids will craft their very own website. (You'll have to print it out to put it on the fridge, mom and dad.)
