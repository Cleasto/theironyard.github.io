Don’t know anything about code? Don&#8217;t worry. You’ll go from zero to hero, and we’ll help you find a job after you graduate (or your tuition back, guaranteed). </p><img src="/images/education/academy/front-end-2/intro-image-6.jpg" /><img src="/images/education/academy/front-end-2/intro-image-2.jpg" /><img src="/images/education/academy/front-end-2/intro-image-9.jpg" /><img src="/images/education/academy/front-end-2/intro-image-3.jpg" /></div><div class="with-this-guy"><h2>With This Guy?</h2><img src="/images/education/academy/front-end-2/mason.jpg" /><p class="your-instructor">Front End Instructor Mason Stewart</p><p><a href="http://twitter.com/masondesu" target="_blank">@masondesu</a> • <a href="http://github.com/masondesu" target="_blank">GitHub</a> </p><p>Mason has worked for small, Southern boutique web shops, startups from San Francisco to Greenville, and everywhere in between. </p><p>He now directs the Iron Yard Academy, which encompasses our kids programs and intensive classes. When he&#8217;s not teaching, he&#8217;s probably learning and writing code for side projects, hacking in Lisp dialects or teaching the Iron Yard&#8217;s chatbot to surprise the other Iron Yarders with memes and gifs.</p></div><div class="when"><h2>When?</h2><p><strong>The next class begins on January 14, 2014.</strong> The intensive course will run 12 weeks, through April 11. Our schedule is set up like a typical five-day work week, with lecture in the morning and lab time in the afternoon. Friday is an open lab day where students can work with the instructor to catch up on projects or get a head start on the weekend&#8217;s homework. </p><img src="/images/education/academy/front-end-2/schedule-chart.png" /><div class="lecture-time"><h3>Lecture Time</h3><p>Our lessons are fast-paced, interactive, and funny. Mason uses a hands-on, live-coding lecture style so that students immediately start developing muscle memory for each new skill. We cover a new subject almost every day, building on previous material. The goal is for you to get your hands dirty absorbing a whole lot of information, then apply it on a real project during lab.</p></div><div class="lab-time"><h3>Lab Time</h3><p>You&#8217;ll have homework every single day, and it ain&#8217;t easy. All assignments are cumulative and ultimately lead up to a final project (unique to each student) that is the crown of your portfolio. If that doesn&#8217;t keep you busy enough, we start sending you real, paid freelance work. You&#8217;ll have access to the space 24 hours a day, just in case you need to burn some midnight oil. </p></div><p class="callout"><strong> Being a programmer is more than just code.</strong> We put serious focus on the qualitative aspects of work, from team projects to mock job interviews.

In the same sense, just knowing syntax doesn&#8217;t make you a programmer; that&#8217;s the easy part of front end development. The emphasis of our class is how to <em>think like an engineer</em>. Programming is a lifelong study, and our goal is for you to learn how to learn. </p><p>That being said, you&#8217;ll leave our class with a toolbox of skills that will set you far apart from other junior-level programmers. You&#8217;ll cover an incredible amount of ground in 3 months, learning everything below and then some. Some topics like Backbone.js will take weeks to cover, others topics like JavaScript templates will be covered over just a few lectures. No matter your learning pace, we work with each student individually to make sure no one falls behind. </p><div class="columns"><ul class="left-column"><li class="expandable">Git and GitHub<ul><li>Branching, merging, committing, etc.</li><li>Workflows for teams in GitHub</li></ul></li><li>HTML</li><li class="expandable">CSS<ul><li>Layouts</li><li>Typography</li><li>Interactions</li><li>CSS3 animations</li></ul></li><li class="expandable">Preprocessors<ul><li>Haml</li><li>Slim</li><li>Sass</li><li>Compass</li></ul></li><li>Responsive CSS / media queries</li><li>Design fundamentals</li><li class="expandable">Freelance fundamentals<ul><li>Finding work</li><li>Contracts/expectations</li><li>Pricing</li><li>Communication</li></ul></li></ul><ul class="center-column"><li class="expandable">JavaScript<ul><li>Types</li><li>Functions</li><li>Objects</li><li>Scope</li><li>Closures</li><li>Constructors</li><li>Prototypes</li><li>JSON</li></ul></li><li class="expandable">jQuery<ul><li>DOM manipulation</li><li>Non-DOM methods ($.extend, $.proxy, etc)</li><li>Chaining</li><li>Callbacks and Promises</li><li>AJAX</li><li>jQuery plugins</li></ul></li><li class="expandable">Underscore.js<ul><li>Underscore basics</li><li>Functional programming principles using undersocre</li></ul></li><li class="expandable">Backbone.js<ul><li>Models, collections, views, routers</li><li>Handling JSON payloads</li><li>Data persistence with the server</li><li>Smart management of views</li></ul></li><li class="expandable">JavaScript Testing<ul><li>Jasmine</li><li>Mocha</li><li>QUnit</li></ul></li><li>CoffeeScript</li><li class="expandable">JavaScript Templating<ul><li>Undersocre.js templates</li><li>Skim templates</li></ul></li><li>Ruby 101</li></ul><ul class="right-column"><li class="expandable">Rails Basics<ul><li>Creating a new Rails app</li><li>Ruby-flavored MVC</li><li>Interfacing with external APIs like Twitter, Instagram, etc.</li></ul></li><li>Heroku Deployment with Git</li><li>Parse as a Backend</li><li class="expandable">Front End Package Managers, Tools, Asset Loaders, and Generators<ul><li>Yeoman</li><li>Grunt</li><li>Bower</li><li>RequireJS</li><li>Sprockets</li></ul></li><li class="expandable">Job search support<ul><li>Mock interviews</li><li>Resume help</li><li>Portfolio prep</li><li>Weekly meetings with our team</li></ul></li></ul></div><p class="excited">Excited?

The answer depends on which school you compare us to, so we&#8217;ll talk through the most common options people ask about. If you want, you can <a href="mailto:eric@theironyard.com?subject=What makes you different than other code schools?">email Eric</a>—he loves talking about code schools on the phone or in person.</p><p><strong>Online resources</strong> </p><p>We love telling people that you can find almost all of the information in our curriculum online, for free. It&#8217;s no secret: &#8220;Google University&#8221; has produced many a fine programmer. In almost every case, though, their skill was forged over years of experience, trial, error, and learning the hard way how much <em>horrible</em> information and advice there is on the internet. With the ever-increasing technological advances in our digital world, it&#8217;s getting even harder to sort the good from the bad. <strong>Our course is designed to trim the fat you find online</strong>, compress learning time time by showing you the right resources, dive far deeper than most internet tutorials take you, and, most importantly, teach you the intangible elements of great programming (collaborative coding, architecture, workflows, good communication, etc.)</p><p><strong>Online code education programs</strong></p><p>We&#8217;re huge fans of online education. In fact, we&#8217;re good friends with the people at <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>, and encourage all of our students to sign up so they can expand their knowledge, learn new languages, and continue practicing the art of code. What&#8217;s more, most students who come to us have spent time in some sort of online code program and realized that becoming a professional developer in the near future is going to take more than a few hours of tutorials on nights and weekends. What many don&#8217;t realize is that most online schools fail to plumb the depths needed in order to be a top-notch developer. Instead of scripted, step-by-step assignments, our exercises focus first on problem solving, meaning students complete the same assignment in a variety of ways. This teaches them the real-world complexity of programming and gives our instructor live examples to teach from.</p><p><strong>Offline code schools</strong></p><p>There are offline code schools popping up all around the world, and from what we can tell, their quality varies widely. After talking with students from other schools, <strong>here are a few things that set our program apart</strong>: </p><ul><li><em>Dollar for dollar, we’re the most accessible program out there</em>. Laptop, housing, a bike, and a job. It doesn’t get much more full service than that. We&#8217;ve had students step off of a plane, take a taxi to the housing, use their bike for the semester, and get hired one-week after graduation. Not bad if we say so ourselves. </li><li><em>We teach far more than code</em>, bringing in guest-lecturers who talk about design fundamentals, how to work well with designers, back-end programmers, entrepreneurs, and more. </li><li><em>We place a high value on soft skills</em>, focusing on the qualitative aspects of being a successful programer, whether that&#8217;s in a freelance career or at a company. We give students feedback on their interaction and contribution in group projects, their communication with us during the program, and the strengths and weaknesses they&#8217;ll carry into their work. On top of this individualized attention, our team lectures throughout the semester on communication skills, freelance contracts, team dynamics, and more.</li><li><em>Our instructors are practicing professionals</em>. We give our teachers one month off between each class, and that time is filled with working on real products, learning the latest technology, and incorporating their learnings into the curriculum to keep it bleeding-edge. </li><li><em>Our job-placement is personalized</em>. Our team works incredibly hard to get students where they want to be, whether that&#8217;s a startup or a large corporation. We have contacts all around the country, and after the program we meet weekly with each student to execute a job-searching strategy with them. We also perform mock interviews so that there aren&#8217;t any surprises when you graduate. </li><li><em>When appropriate, we give our students paid freelance work before they graduate</em>. If students have extra bandwidth, we connect them with partner companies who pay cash for contract work, meaning real portfolio work and references when they graduate. </li><li><em>We work on real projects for real people</em>. Whether it&#8217;s an internal tool for The Iron Yard or an actual product our team or one of our Accelerators is building, our students have the chance to work on real live stuff that actual customers will use. </li><li><em>You get access to the entire Iron Yard family</em>. Whether it&#8217;s working shoulder-to-shoulder with our accelerator teams, sitting in on mentor sessions, networking with our CoWorkers, or looking through our Rolodex and asking for introductions, we give you any resource we can to help you be successful.</li><li><em>We partner with awesome sponsors</em>. Our sponsors provide amazing resources to our students, from free accounts to web-design assets. Check them out at the bottom of the page. </li></ul></div></div></li><li class="question even job"><div class="container span8"><h3>You&#8217;ll help me find a job?</h3><div class="answer"><p>If you choose to enroll in the job placement program, we’ll do our darndest to put you where you want to be, and we’re putting our money where our mouth is.</p><p>We cannot guarantee the exact salary or location of the job, but if you don’t get an offer in six months, we’ll give you your tuition back. <a href="mailto:academy@theironyard.com?subject=I have a question about the job placement program">Contact us for more details</a>.</p></div></div></li><li class="question odd greenville"><div class="container span8"><h3>What&#8217;s up with Greenville?</h3><div class="answer"><p>Greenville is an amazing place to live.

Aside from comfy furniture, they have a pool table, an open source video game console but best of all, you can draw on almost every wall in the building.&#8221;</em> <strong>—Ari Picker, Class of August, 2013</strong></p><p>Want to talk to a graduate? <a href="mailto:academy@theironyard.com?subject=I'd like to talk to a Front End Engineering graduate">Give us a shout and we&#8217;ll connect you</a>.</p></div></div></li></div><div class="fed-2 base our-sponsors-container"><div class="container span8"><div class="our-sponsors"><h2>Our Sponsors</h2><p>Our sponsors support our students by offering free accounts, assets, and more.
