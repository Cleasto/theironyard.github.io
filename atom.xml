<p>There are many ways to judge company culture, from the general work environment to the language used, from the design of the space to what employees discuss off the clock. Measures abound, and so do opinions about them.</p>

<p>In our space most of the walls are whiteboard material, and there are dry-erase markers everywhere. Our students, CoWorkers and startups use the blank canvases more than I&rsquo;ve seen in any other office I&rsquo;ve been in, but not for work. They use drawing boards mostly as a goofy, fun, creative outlet <em>as a break</em> from work.</p>

<p>A lot of it is really weird.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t thought too deeply into what that behavior reveals about our culture, so I thought I&rsquo;d show you some pictures and let you decide.</p>

<p><em>The following article is a guest post from Jon-Michial Carter, CEO/co-founder of Chartspan, one of our Digital Health Accelerator teams.</em></p>

<h4>Form vs. Function</h4>

<p>Jony Ives and Steve Jobs single handedly introduced a generation of technologists to “design.” Abused adjectives such as “elegant” and “gorgeous” are applied to the vernacular of product launches ranging from vacuums to software. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Let’s dissect “design” for a moment. What does “design” mean to you? In anticipation of writing this piece I quickly asked four people what the word “design” meant to them. All four used words like “aesthetics,” “the way something looks,” and “appearance.” All are accurate, but incomplete.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>Design requires form and function. We obsess over form. Whether it’s a style of jeans or the colors that compliment our living room furniture, the vanity of form is a steady stream of conscious thought for most.</p>

<p>The “function” of design is “form’s” red headed stepsister. Nowhere is that more true than in the technology world. We produce software at a staggering frequency with little to no validation that the intended function satisfies the end user.</p>

<p>My frame of reference is the technology start-up world. As I lead the launch of a startup called ChartSpan (patient healthcare technology) I am curiously frightened at the amount of time and money spent on launching start-up companies that have never tested the hypothesis of their solution with end-users prior to releasing their product.</p>

<p>Most start-ups are based on an innovative concept that is trying to solve some real world problem. The founders of those companies dance the Silicon Valley jig until someone agrees to fund their idea. Developers and marketers are hired, office space is rented and millions of dollars are invested to get the product out to the public.</p>

<p>90% of all start-ups fail. Why? Nobody wanted their product. Did millions of dollars need to be spent in order to find this out? No, not if intelligent design practices were followed.  They usually aren’t.</p>

<h4>We’re Wrong</h4>

<p>ChartSpan was accepted into the Iron Yard Digital Healthcare Accelerator this summer. We showed up to the Accelerator on day one with our product and marketing strategy complete. We spent 15 months building our product. We looked forward to refinement, but the hard work was done. We were ready to launch. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>A smart man named Peter Barth runs The Iron Yard. Unlike most who have had financial success in the entrepreneurial world, Peter is modest. He is astutely observant and connected. He lets you make mistakes and helps you get back up when you stumble.</p>

<p>Peter recognized my headstrong manner had led to the creation of a company and product that had never seen a moment of functional design validation. We obsessed over the user experience, but our design was based on logic derived from our own common sense assessments. Never did we test or validate with our intended audience.</p>

<p>To this day I view what happened next as the most important day in our company’s young life. Peter organized a private meeting with four User Interface and User Experience design experts. He went out of his way to organize the meeting, ensuring it was catered with food and attended by all.</p>

<p>The meeting was humbling. The four design experts trashed our experience and interface. They were kind, but forthright. It became clear that everything surrounding our design needed to be rethought. They also challenged us to stop assuming we knew what our users wanted. They pushed us to validate our assumptions.</p>

<p>We felt lost. I’ve overseen development projects for at least 25 of the Fortune 500. I thought I understood design. What I learned was that UX (user experience) must be separated from UI (user interface). UX should not be left in the hands of graphic artists and developers, or worse, the company founders. The software’s navigation, function and experience must be separated and elevated in importance.</p>

<p>Next, I searched for an experienced UX design professional. I found Mary Treat-Massey, a graduate of Clemson’s Human Factor design program. My co-founder David and I fondly refer to our experience with Mary as our “come to Jesus moment.” <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Mary taught us the basics of UX design. She taught us how to create scenario tests. She taught us how to measure and evaluate user experience. She helped us redesign our entire product, based on what users told us they wanted and validated, not what we thought they wanted.</p>

<p>It turns out everything we thought our users wanted was completely wrong. Our redesign looks nothing like our original product. It has become remarkably simple. Menus have been simplified. Features have been added and stripped. The UX and UI are now “elegant” and “gorgeous” by virtue of being well thought out and functional rather than trying to force design on top of a bad interface. The whole experience has been made simpler and more intuitive by listening to how our end-users expect the process to work. The key word is “listening”; you have to be open and willing to accept the fact your assumptions are wrong. We were humbled, but in the end we came out the other side with a much more polished and well thought-out product.</p>

<p>On the eve of our launch, as I stand back and look at what we’ve created, I am proud. <strong>It’s no longer my product</strong>. It’s a product that has been 100% designed by a group of non-technical mothers (our intended end-user.) The process has actually removed the uncertainty of wondering how the public will react when we release. <em>We already know how they will react</em>.</p>

<em>Jen Ngetich, Class of April &lsquo;13</em></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been teaching programming and hardware hacking to kids for almost a year now at The Iron Yard, and the students have been a wonderful mix of girls and boys, from a wide range of economic, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds. Through flat-out-free classes and full scholarships for paid classes, we&rsquo;ve tried to make sure that any child with even a modicum of curiosity has a chance to learn programming.</p>

<p>On many occasions, the mothers, older sisters, and aunts of our students have expressed that they wish programs like ours had existed years ago. Many women we&rsquo;ve spoken to were <em>directly discouraged</em> from STEM when they were younger, being told, &ldquo;engineering is for men.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Making tech a more welcoming environment for <em>everyone</em> is a cause we support wholeheartedly, and we&rsquo;re working to make that vision reality.</p>

<p><strong>As our first effort, I&rsquo;m thrilled to announce that next semester we&rsquo;re offering two women a $1500 scholarship towards our Front End Engineering class in January</strong>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>In addition to the normal student application, those seeking scholarships will be asked to write a brief essay (600 words) on how they plan to help promote women in tech (the application link is at the end of the post). <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re incredibly proud of all of our students and graduates and the contributions they&rsquo;ve already made to make tech more welcoming and accessible in our community.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t wait to continue the tradition next semester with a focus on women in tech.</p>

    <id>http://theironyard.com/blog/2013/10/17/the-little-freelancer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<hr />

<p>Have you ever done freelance or contract work? If so, do you remember the excitement and fear at the beginning of your journey? How about your first client? Your first big check?</p>

<p>Realizing you are your own boss is great—you get to set your own schedule, choose the tools you use, and (hopefully) make way more money than you did in your junior-level 9-5 gig.</p>

<p>But, as may have discovered, it&rsquo;s not that simple.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Do you remember the feeling in your gut the first time you got an email from an upset client? Or way underquoted a project and realized you brought home a whopping $4/hr?</p>

<p>Discovering the hard parts of freelancing is an extremely discouraging experience and has made for lots of unhappy workers and clients.</p>

<p>Much of this pain is unnecessary. Sure, not everyone is cut out to work for themselves, but for most people even a little bit of guidance can significantly flatten the learning curve and build the foundation for a great career.</p>

<p>Several current students (and graduates) in our Front End Engineering course are pursuing freelance, so over the past week I&rsquo;ve been developing curriculum that will help them learn the ropes and not repeat the many mistakes I made early on.</p>

<p>The notes for a few lectures turned into sizable guide, and we decided to <a href="https://github.com/ericdodds/the-little-freelancer">open source the whole thing</a>. It&rsquo;s called <strong>The Little Freelancer</strong>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>We hope it will make lots of freelancers and their clients happy. We also hope people smarter than us will contribute to it.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a snippet from the first section:</p>

<blockquote><h4>Welcome to customer service</h4>

<p>This guide covers practical advice ranging from your first client meeting to self employment taxes. Before we get there, though, we want to remind you of something <strong>really</strong> important:</p>

<p><strong><em>The way you treat people will always be more important than the work you do.</em></strong></p>

<p>There are incredibly talented programmers out there who are jerks and struggle to find work because people don&rsquo;t like being around them. There are also bad programmers who always have jobs because people like to work with them.</p>

<p>No matter what career you&rsquo;re going to pursue, writing good code is only the cost of entry. Your goal is to produce top-notch work <em>and</em> be someone that others want to work with.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you followed along last week, you know that we broke a 55-day silent streak on the blog. You&rsquo;ll also have seen, and read about, a change we made to the format of our posts: <strong>no in-text hyperlinks in the body of articles</strong> (except on Fridays).</p>

<p>A vast majority of text online includes links, and the prevailing technique for displaying them is to utilize existing words in content:</p>

<!-- more -->


<blockquote><p>If you followed along last week, you know that we <a href="#">broke a 55-day silent streak</a> on the blog.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our new format places a footnote indicator at the end of each paragraph, which points to an explanatory footnote, including links to the information referenced in that section of the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you followed along last week, you know that we broke a 55-day silent streak on the blog. You&rsquo;ll also have seen, and read about, a change we made to the format of our posts: <strong>no in-text hyperlinks in the body of articles</strong> (except on Fridays).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>There are several reasons for the new format.</p>

<p><strong>First, footnotes allow authors to place hyperlinks in a much richer context.</strong> Better context adds value for the reader in several ways. If an author references a separate work, showing the reader <em>what</em> is referenced and, more importantly, <em>why</em>, provides a more complete explanation of the thought and why the writer chose to include the source. Also, references are often used to point to resources that explore a subject in more depth, giving the audience a pathway to further research a topic if it seems valuable or interesting. Context allows readers to make more informed decisions about whether they want—or even need—to follow a pathway.</p>

<p>In-text hyperlinks have a relatively low capacity for providing rich context. This is because there&rsquo;s always some level of mystery about where exactly a link will take you. Even if the in-text link is well executed, some level of unknown makes assigning value to a link more difficult for readers.</p>

<p>Footnotes provide an elegant solution. They allow the audience to read an author&rsquo;s complete thoughts and better evaluate the value of various pathways <em>after</em> they&rsquo;ve digested the entire piece.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t read what I&rsquo;m not writing: we&rsquo;re not against the in-text hyperlink. In fact, there are times in which clicking to an &lsquo;unknown&rsquo; destination can provide surprise and delight to readers. That&rsquo;s why we use them in our Lazy Friday Links posts. (After all, who doesn&rsquo;t like a witty reference that links to a GIF? <a href="http://media.giphy.com/media/KPG9BKcXVwHO8/giphy.gif">They make people smile</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Woah,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you making a big deal about nothing? In-text hyperlinks are <em>how writing on the internet is</em>.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>No, we&rsquo;re not. This is important stuff. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>

<p>That &lsquo;unknown&rsquo; value of an in-text link inhibits your ability to get the most out of a piece of writing. When your brain sees another pathway, it will, by default, evaluate whether or not it should follow that pathway. The less context, the harder the decision for your brain. Repeat that process over and over throughout an article that requires critical thinking, and you have a recipe for constant distraction and hindered ability to process what is being said.</p>

<p>In an excellent article about the dark side of modern news, author Rolf Dobelli explains this phenomenon:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thinking requires concentration. Concentration requires uninterrupted time. News pieces are specifically engineered to interrupt you. They are like viruses that steal attention for their own purposes. News makes us shallow thinkers. But it&rsquo;s worse than that. News severely affects memory. There are two types of memory. Long-range memory&rsquo;s capacity is nearly infinite, but working memory is limited to a certain amount of slippery data. The path from short-term to long-term memory is a choke-point in the brain, but anything you want to understand must pass through it. If this passageway is disrupted, nothing gets through. Because news disrupts concentration, it weakens comprehension. Online news has an even worse impact. In a 2001 study two scholars in Canada showed that comprehension declines as the number of hyperlinks in a document increases. Why? Because whenever a link appears, your brain has to at least make the choice not to click, which in itself is distracting. News is an intentional interruption system.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dobelli is referencing an article by Nicholas Carr called &ldquo;The Web Shatters Focus, Rewires Brains.&rdquo; (don&rsquo;t worry, links to these pieces will be in the footnotes at the bottom of the page). In the piece, Carr talks about neuroplacticity—the ability of of our brains to actually re-wire themselves. In short, if we constantly put strain on our ability to process things on a deep level, that ability will begin to diminish.</p>

<blockquote><p>The penalty is amplified by what brain scientists call switching costs. Every time we shift our attention, the brain has to reorient itself, further taxing our mental resources. Many studies have shown that switching between just two tasks can add substantially to our cognitive load, impeding our thinking and increasing the likelihood that we’ll overlook or misinterpret important information. On the Internet, where we generally juggle several tasks, the switching costs pile ever higher.</p>

<p>&hellip;That means our online habits continue to reverberate in the workings of our brain cells even when we’re not at a computer. We’re exercising the neural circuits devoted to skimming and multitasking while ignoring those used for reading and thinking deeply.</p></blockquote>

<p>In-text links aren&rsquo;t bad. But as these authors and many others point out, the distraction they cause is <em>can take a toll on your mind</em>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>On a web that seems to encourage endless amounts of distraction, entertainment addiction, and sensationalism, we want to foster healthy brains. Footnotes seem like a great place to start.</p>

<p>Yesterday we broke a 55 day streak of silence on the blog. That means Lazy Friday Links are back, baby.</p>

<p>Not sure what Lazy Friday Links are?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We started this end-of-the-week tradition to celebrate productivity by engaging in meaningless disctraction. Well, mostly. We include a single thought-provoking link (so we don&rsquo;t feel like complete slackers), and a healthy drink from distraction-filled ocean of internet weirdness. We used to put the heady stuff first, but we&rsquo;ll save that for last so you don&rsquo;t have to bother if you don&rsquo;t want to.</p>

<p><em>Also, as a sidenote, in yesterday&rsquo;s post, we mentioned that we&rsquo;re not going to sprinkle hyperlinks throughout our posts, forgoing the most common reference method for footnotes, like this.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Because Lazy Friday Links is all about distraction, we&rsquo;ll ignore that rule. But only on Fridays.</em></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s almost too much thinking already, so let&rsquo;s move onward to diversion.</p>

<p><strong>Number one</strong><br/>
Fifty-five minutes and fifteen seconds of <a href="https://vimeo.com/55006097">pure 80s televison gold</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Number two</strong><br/>
An amazing reel of NFL Kickoff footage <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1USHmMw2dI8#t=45">quoting a famous scene from <em>The Princess Bride</em></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Number three</strong><br/>
Bill Nye the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DrXpLu5.gif">science</a> guy.</p>

<p><strong>Number four</strong><br/>
A frighteningly well executed stopping of a car and arresting of its driver, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/i2Z85jB.jpg">through the winshield</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Number five (warning: requires thought)</strong><br/>
You might have noticed that technology has upended industry after industry in the last few years, and it&rsquo;s picking up speed. If you haven&rsquo;t noticed that, well, it&rsquo;s Friday. We can all be happy.</p>

<p>Adam Davidson <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/01/making-it-in-america/308844/">wrote a fascinating piece</a> exploring technology in manufacturing and how it affects jobs of workers in that industry. Here&rsquo;s a taste:</p>

<blockquote><p>The double shock we’re experiencing now—globalization and computer-aided industrial productivity—happens to have the opposite impact: income inequality is growing, as the rewards for being skilled grow and the opportunities for unskilled Americans diminish.</p>

<p>I went to South Carolina, and spent so much time with Maddie, precisely because these issues are so large and so overwhelming. I wanted to see how this shift affected regular people’s lives.</p></blockquote>

<p>Happy Friday. It&rsquo;s good to be back.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<hr />

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, everyone. We still exist.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been exactly 55 days of radio silence on our blog, but we have really good excuses (and a few not-so-good ones).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><em>(You&rsquo;ll notice that all hyperlinks are at the bottom of the post. Here&rsquo;s why<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.)</em></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been up to:</p>

<h4>Heavy duty work on our website</h4>

<p>You may have noticed a few color and style changes around the site, but those are only symptoms of deep re-constructive surgery. Mason originally built our site as a Ruby app running Active Admin (a GUI for managing content) and we&rsquo;ve been <em>really</em> busy transitioning the entire system to run on a platform called Jekyll.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> (We&rsquo;ll detail all of the nerdy stuff in a future post.)</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, yours truly has been spending some quality time with code in the last few months.</p>

<h4>Moving our Greenville offices, again.</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;re back in our original offices space at the NEXT Innovation Center. (Mason and I accomplished 90% of the move in 12 hours by ourselves. It was a long day.) Several amazing CoWorkers are in our space, and we&rsquo;re enjoying the fresh take on our old digs.</p>

<p><img src="http://theironyard.com/images/blog/2013/09/9.19.13/the-forge-coworking-space.jpg" style="border-radius: 3px;"></p>

<h4>Sprinting with our Digital Health accelerator teams</h4>

<p>Our latest accelerator class has been running tirelessly towards their October 2nd Demo Day in at the Health 2.0 Conference in San Francisco. If you&rsquo;re in the Bay area, be sure to come to their pitch session. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Our class has made incredible progress. James Rogers, head of Mayo Clinic Ventures was just in town to spend time with our teams and check out everything happening at The Iron Yard. We couldn&rsquo;t do this without the support of our mentors.</p>

<h4>Making some exciting changes to our Open Tech accelerator</h4>

<p>Stay tuned for more info soon. 2014 is going to be an awesome year.</p>

<h4>Doubling the size of our Front End Engineering class in the Academy</h4>

<p><img src="http://theironyard.com/images/blog/2013/09/9.19.13/fee-class-august-2013.jpg" style="border-radius: 3px;"></p>

<p>The size of our flagship Academy class, Front End Engineering, more than doubled this semester. In the process of managing growth, Mason and I have been pulling out all of the stops and making the <em>experience</em> of class as good as the curriculum. More details in a future post. Also, applications for our January class are open, but it&rsquo;s filling up.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<h4>Offering all sorts of new courses through the Academy</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;re expanding our subject matter. So far we&rsquo;ve worked on material for Ruby on Rails, iOS development, mobile app design, design fundamentals, and digital productivity. You can always find a list of current classes on our website.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<h4>Teaching even more kids to code</h4>

<p>CoderDojo is back in action running two nights per week, one class on Scratch and one class on Electronics. We&rsquo;ve also started after school programs that will cover more advanced subjects including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, Racket, and advanced electronics.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<h4>Planning for Grok 2014</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;re already working on details for Grok 2014, and we&rsquo;ll announce ticket sales soon.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<h4>Drawing on the walls</h4>

<p>Our students—kids and adults—love writing on our whiteboard walls. Here&rsquo;s a particularly awesome drawing of a dragon wearing a fanny pack.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re nearing the end of our first Front End Engineering course, and it&rsquo;s been an amazing experience. Halfway through the course we talked to both students and guest lecturers to see what they had to say. Here are a few responses.</p>

<!-- more -->


<hr />

<h3>Guest Design Instructor – Marco Suarez</h3>

<p>We invited our friend Marco, now an Art Director at MailChimp, to spend a week teaching our Front End Engineering students about design. He gave them crash courses on everything from color theory and design thinking to responsive web design techniques.</p>

<p>After the class we asked him what he thought about the students, and he told us they&rsquo;re the type of talent he&rsquo;s looking to hire. Take it away, Marco:</p>

<hr />

<h3>Student – Andrew McIntee</h3>

<p>Andrew McIntee started working as a front end developer in high school. After graduation, he tried college, but decided that jumping into a design career would be more satisfying. As he gained experience he noticed that his value to clients could increase dramatically if he could both design and develop digital products.</p>

<p>He came to The Iron Yard Academy&rsquo;s Front End Engineering course to increase his code chops, and says that three months here has been worth three years in his career. He&rsquo;s busy with freelance work, but is ready for a full time job at a cool company. Hire while it&rsquo;s hot. Here&rsquo;s Andrew telling his story:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Startup Life™ is thickly shrouded with threats of difficulty. First you&rsquo;re required to have an astoundingly novel idea that promises to capture a gigantic industry or market. (Or at least be able to convince people of those things.) Next, you need a killer team, preferably one with a brilliant engineer co-founder who&rsquo;s willing to give up a six-figure income to work tirelessly on your product.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Later you discover that the importance of the idea pales in comparison to execution: if you can&rsquo;t ship, you&rsquo;re dead in the water. Courting VCs and negotiating term sheets, if you&rsquo;re one of the lucky few to beat that many levels and face the boss, is a black art in and of itself, and one wrong step can flush everything you&rsquo;ve worked for down the drain. Work/life balance as most know isn&rsquo;t even part of the equation for many entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>After running an accelerator program for 7 months, though, I&rsquo;ve learned that one of the most trying hurdles is the minefield of different &lsquo;advice&rsquo; startups get along the way.</p>

<p>Early stage companies &ndash; especially those in mentorship-driven programs &ndash; face an inordinate flood of conflicting opinions on every aspect of their company. From inconsequential design details to overall strategy, teams can receive unending praise and completely deflating interrogation in the same day. Both types of feedback come from successful people who&rsquo;s resumés command a level of respect.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t have strong conviction about your product and company, incongruous advice can toss you like a row boat in a hurricane. If you question your your compass enough times, it can be hard to remember why you started the journey in the first place.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that stubbornness has killed many companies, but requiring clear and convincing evidence to change has made some of the most successful businesses in the world just that.</p>

<p>There is no lack of smart people, good ideas, and money to put behind them. My bet will be on teams with real conviction.</p>

    <id>http://theironyard.com/blog/2013/05/04/what-we-learned-starting-an-intensive-design-class</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a post from Marco Suarez explaining what we&rsquo;ve learned on the journey of starting an intensive design school.</em></p>

<p>There is a gap that is widening between the education students are receiving and the skills companies require. The most obvious disconnect is in software and technology. Universities fail to keep up and the proponents of an informal, self-taught education use that deficiency as their banner. But technology and software are platforms and tools. And just because you know how to use a tool doesn’t make you a craftsman. The more serious gap is in a person’s ability to think. Mobile touch platforms have radically changed the way we use technology, so much so that it has caused broad societal shift. The potential of this shift is fueling investors to pour insane amounts of money into people and ideas that take advantage of it. There is a need for designers who can think critically and creatively to solve real problems by utilizing these new platforms and tools.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>And this is where The Iron Yard comes into the story. The Iron Yard is a company in the southeast that has set up residence at the gates of new tech ideation. And we saw an opportunity. We know software and technology really well and we know companies that are hiring. So we started an <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/education/academy/front-end-engineering">intensive front end engineering program</a> this year that is doing great. So great that we decided to spin up a <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/education/academy/product-design">design program</a> that focuses on digital product design. We’d teach the process of design thinking through building real applications for real people. We’d assess problems and build prototypes, brands, and interfaces for web and mobile. Sounded like a home run. So we thought.</p>

<p>The vast differences between teaching code and design &ndash; and recruiting students for each discipline &ndash; taught us a lot about the state of education. Teaching code is similar to teaching math—either you know it or you don’t. Design is different. It’s subjective. It assembles culture, metaphors, art, and taste with problems, challenges, and data. So you could say it is similar to teaching English. A lot of people think they’re good enough at English that they don’t need to further their learning of the language.</p>

<p>Another observation is the people in our front end engineering program didn’t have any previous experience with code, and they didn’t need to. After a month of class, they were as proficient as me and I’ve been doing this stuff for a decade. Kudos to their teacher, Mason Stewart. But our design program wasn’t a foundational design course. It was a higher learning program that would add another tool to their design toolbox. This changed our target market drastically. In the pool of designers, we were targeting those who wanted to shift out of designing consumables (websites, advertising, and marketing) to designing software for startups. So our task was to get our program in front of those people.</p>

<p>We tried some PR, social media, and whatever else but to no avail. And then we remembered <a href="http://theironyard.com/images/blog/2013/04/the-gap-or-why-we-started-a-design-course/">the gap</a>. Universities do a good job giving students a solid design foundation. They give students four years to get it wrong, experiment, and expand their minds. This was a foundation we could build on. So we scheduled some meetings with local universities and found an overwhelmingly positive response to what we were offering. Universities recognize where they’re falling short and supplementing their program with ours seemed like a match made in heaven. So we narrowed our focus to students. This is where it got interesting.</p>

<p>I assumed that this technologically saturated generation would be so starved for digital literacy that our program would be cool water to their lips. But I could not have been more wrong. These students all owned iPhones, Androids, and tablets and computers of all kinds. They’re all active users on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and all sorts of apps but none of them had ever thought they could work for one of these companies. When I mentioned that we would be learning to write some code, I completely lost them. At that point our class was not only foreign, it was intimidating. And who is going to sign away three months of their lives and a bunch of money to be intimidated and frustrated and then be placed in an ever more intimidating and frustrating job?</p>

<p>Two weeks away from the inaugural launch of our class, we had two signups. We approached students just weeks away from graduation about pretty much changing the trajectory of their career. Not such a good idea. In order to create action you have to first reveal the need for action. And we were asking these students to act before they fully realized the need. We were a little overzealous. But we believe the greatest need for our program is in bridging the gap between universities and companies.And now that we know our target market, we can form a plan that entices students early on, accommodates their schedules and budgets, and place them in jobs where they can fully utilize their minds and their knowledge of software and technology.</p>

<p>We’re working out ideas like one day classes on Saturdays, classes that fit into a normal semester, and the summer long intensive program with a guaranteed job placement. Whatever the end product looks like, the need is growing, and The Iron Yard is passionate about training the next generation of great designers.</p>

    <link href="http://theironyard.com/blog/2013/04/15/kate-mccarthy-five-things-i-learned-at-lessconf/"/>

    <id>http://theironyard.com/blog/2013/04/15/kate-mccarthy-five-things-i-learned-at-lessconf</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This weekend I had the opportunity to attend LessConf. As a new comer to the tech/startup world and a first timer at what has to be (for lack of a better term) <em>the __coolest conference in the history</em>, I wanted to share a few take aways. Here are the top five things I learned at LessConf.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><strong>1)   It’s better to be awesome than perfect.</strong> Hosts <a href="mailto:https://twitter.com/allanbranch">Allan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/stevenbristol">Steve</a> and their international clan of programming weirdo cool kids really drove this home for me.  Steve’s response to weak wifi in the old movie theater where the first batch of talks went down: “I don’t care.  You shouldn’t be on the internet anyway.” These guys really embody the ethos of striving for awesomeness rather than perfection.</p>

<p><strong>2)   E-mail attachments might be your golden ticket.  </strong>Just ask <a href="https://twitter.com/Ryohara">Ryan O’Hara</a> from <a href="http://dyn.com/">Dyn</a> who gave some sage advice on how to craft cold e-mails. EX: after a potential client he reached out to didn’t respond, he followed up with an email + photo attachment of him lying prostrate and depressed on the floor. Rule of thumb, even if you don’t get their business, make them fall in love with you.****</p>

<p><strong>3)   Baby kangaroos are my kryptonite. </strong>At the opening dinner we were introduced to magical wildlife including a baby alligator and this absurdly adorable baby kangaroo. Just look at him!</p>

<p><img src="http://theironyard.com/images/blog/2013/04/Untitled.png" style="border-radius: 3px;"></p>

<p><strong>4)   Ask and ye shall receive.</strong> The basics were well covered: from bug spray to sun screen (thanks <a href="https://www.engineyard.com">Engine Yard</a>) there wasn&rsquo;t much wanting. The above and beyond came from conversations with the world class humans. Ex: Over breakfast, I lamented the difficulty we non-technical people have communicating desired website changes to our fabulous techie friends. Dun dah dah dun! Enter<a href="https://twitter.com/jayroh"> Joel Oliveira</a> from ThoughtBot who blew my mind with a demo of <a href="http://evernote.com/skitch/">Skitch</a>. THANK YOU.****</p>

<p><strong>5)   Kill features that don&rsquo;t increase revenue.</strong> On day two of talks, we took to the ocean for more pearls of wisdom. <a href="https://twitter.com/Shpigford">Josh Pigford</a> of <a href="https://www.popsurvey.com">Pop Survey</a> explained the urge to constantly ship new features, you know, a more is more philosophy. Instead, he encouraged the audience to kill any feature that doesn’t increase your revenue. Revenue neutral? Adios. I’d say this goes for life too. Often we add activities, classes, cleanses, and other “features” to our lives better. My challenge? Kill the features that don’t improve your bottom line of awesome.****</p>

<p><strong>And just because I can, I’m going to add a sixth and final learning.</strong> Probably the biggest one of all. The tech/startup world is full of compassionate, alarmingly intelligent, bizarre, supportive, non-judgmental, goal oriented world class humans. I can’t imagine a better group to call my tribe.</p>

<p><em>From our Product Design instructor, <a href="http://twitter.com/marcosuarez">Marco</a>:</em></p>

<p>Education is a hot topic. Does the value of a diploma out weight the ever-rising cost of tuition? I think the answer is overwhelmingly yes for some careers. But not all. In the world of design, what you’ve done carries more weight than where you went to school. That has been a known truth for quite some years. But with the advent of smart phones and tablets, the demand for qualified digital product designers has seen an unprecedented uptick. So how are designers learning these lucrative skills?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Universities excel at offering strong foundations of design theory, peer collaboration, and a period of focus and dedication, but at a mortgage level price tag.The problem is not only the cost; universities struggle to keep up with how quickly the design industry evolves. Never before has design been so tightly melded with technology. Terms like user experience, mobile design and interface design are becoming commonplace on design job boards but largely absent in curriculums.</p>

<p>Online learning has been evolving over the last few years to supplement, if not replace a formal education. These programs have growth rates that would make any CEO green with envy. Their model is a nominal monthly fee in exchange for video tutorials and projects that educate the viewer on cutting edge trends in website and app development. But where these programs excel at teaching the latest software and technology, they lack in one-on-one guidance, emphasis on design theory, and in-person collaboration with other students.</p>

<p>So are these the only options? Is there not something that fits in the gap between these avenues of education? We think so. And that’s what we&rsquo;re building at The Iron Yard. This year we started an <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/education/academy">Academy</a>, offering affordable, accessible three-month-intensive classes in Greenville, SC. We just started a front-end engineering class and we’re gearing up to start a <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/education/academy/product-design">digital product design class this May</a>.</p>

<p>Our digital product design course will teach students the process of design thinking, how to develop ideas based on data and observation, create and test prototypes, build brands, design interfaces for web and mobile, and teach them cutting-edge technology and software.</p>

<p>They’ll have one-on-one guidance from a seasoned professional designer, work collaboratively and individually, and tackle live projects that benefit real people.They’ll have exposure to startups in our accelerator program and opportunities to meet and learn from some of the best and brightest designers in the industry. (Course mentors include Matthew Smith, Aaron Walter, and Josh Brewer.)</p>

<p>We will provide housing just down the road from our facility in downtown Greenville and a bike for transportation. All day-to-day necessities are in walking distance. We’ll also provide a brand new Apple laptop and access to Adobe’s Creative Cloud during the course &ndash; that way our students can focus all their attention on the course and projects.</p>

<p>Our mission is not to replace a formal education nor the need for online learning, but fill a gap that our shifting industry has created, train people for great jobs, and build meaningful projects in the process.</p>
